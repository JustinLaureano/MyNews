As the Guardian reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/06/brexit-eu-power-punish-uk-transition-period-sanctions\">in a story before the document was formally published, </a>it said that the EU should have the power to penalise the UK during the transition by closing off parts of the single market to British companies if resolving disputes by going to the European court of justice would take too long.</p> <p>The story referred to footnote 4, which said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In addition, the governance and dispute settlement part of the withdrawal agreement should provide for a mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market where it considers that referring the matter to the court of justice of the European Union would not bring in appropriate time the necessary remedies.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the time some commentators downplayed the significance of this, arguing that clauses like this are routine in trade agreements.</p> <p>Bu <strong>David Davis</strong>, the Brexit secretary, has given an interview today strongly criticising the commission for publishing that document. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That document was hardly a legal document, it was a political document. What we\u2019re about, is building an implementation period, which is to build a bridge to a future where we work well together. And I do not think it was in good faith to publish a document with frankly discourteous language, and actually implying that they could arbitrarily terminate, in effect, the implementation period. That\u2019s not what the aim of this exercise is, it\u2019s not in good faith, and we think it\u2019s unwise to publish that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bad faith is quite a charge. Davis is not just saying the commission made a mistake; he is coming close to saying Michel Barnier, his opposite number, cannot be trusted. It is hard to think of anything that UK government has said about provocative about the EU in public <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/03/theresa-may-accuses-eu-of-meddling-in-uk-general-election\">since Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street broadside about interfering Eurocrats during the general election.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c8151e4b05abd28aabd9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:57:55.912Z\">4.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said today\u2019s meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee lasted a little more than two hours, but declined to give further details of what was discussed.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c7f50e4b0365be516828e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:55:56.672Z\">4.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Press Association has filed more quotes from <strong>Koji Tsuruoka</strong>, the Japanese ambassador to the UK. Speaking after he and Japanese business figures met the prime minister, he said said manufacturing firms in particular \u201cexpected\u201d free access to the European market to continue. He said:</p> <p>It\u2019s not just to the UK that we are presenting those positions. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japan has also approached the EU secretariat in Brussels to make the point that the continuation of healthy, sound trade relations between UK and EU is benefitting not just UK but also EU, and hence the global economy as a whole because this is a very important economy that has very important weight in the health of the global economy, and Japan is playing a major role on both sides as a major investor. </p> <p>Therefore we have a high stake on this and I think it\u2019s the recognition of the Japanese importance on this trade area that the prime minister has allocated a considerable amount of time to meet and discuss all aspects of the negotiation with Japanese industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tsuruoka said Japanese firms wanted to stay in the UK.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japanese companies are enjoying their operations in the UK and they have also today said they would very much like to continue this successful operation in the UK, which of course is comprised with access to the European market. Therefore the question is whether the arrangements that will be reached between the two sides will allow the Japanese companies, who are willing and in some ways determined to continue to operate in the UK, to allow them to make that happen. </p> <p>This is contingent on a number of factors and there is not just one single factor that will be determining the decision. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41f264303b5c1b72f17fe387a235bee50bde0cc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41f264303b5c1b72f17fe387a235bee50bde0cc1/0_95_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Koji Tsuruoaka, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Britain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Koji Tsuruoaka, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Britain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c7b16e4b05abd28aabd5f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:38:47.266Z\">4.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As Sky\u2019s <strong>Faisal Islam</strong> reports, while the Japanese business leaders were in Number 10 talking to Theresa May, the Tory Brexiter <strong>Jacob Rees-Mogg </strong>turned up to deliver a petition calling for lower aid spending.

Sources close to the talks claim that a deal to restore power sharing devolved government could happen within days. They claim there has been some movement on the divisive issue of Sinn Fein\u2019s demand for an Irish Language Act, which would put Gaelic on the same legal parity as English across the region.</p> <p>Under this fledgling deal Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, would return as first minister of Northern Ireland. This would mark a shift in Sinn Fein\u2019s position from 13 months ago.</p> <p>The talks broke down at the start of 2017 after the late Martin McGuinness resigned in protest as deputy first minister. He stood down from the post and effectively crashed the power sharing system because first minister Foster refused to temporarily step aside from her post. Foster had been under pressure to do so as criticism mounted over her promotion of a renewable green energy scheme that has cost the tax payer tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>Both the British and Irish governments - both on and off the record - continue to paint a positive picture of the crucial discussions between Sinn Fein and the DUP. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said today that he \u201cremained convinced\u201d that an agreement can and will be reached. </p> <p>One key factor in Sinn Fein seeking a compromise with the DUP is the appointment of a new leader this weekend. Dublin politician Mary Lou McDonald will replace Gerry Adams as Sinn Fein President this Saturday marking a generational shift within the high command of the party. </p> <p>A power-sharing deal, which would be welcomed among all political classes on both these islands, would be seen as giving a boost to the credentials of the McDonald-led Sinn Fein, particularly among southern Irish voters who until now have been repelled by the party\u2019s historic links to the IRA\u2019s armed campaign during the Northern Ireland Troubles. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dc7b445eb168dea4cc7b4adff55b7142fde4f72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dc7b445eb168dea4cc7b4adff55b7142fde4f72/0_99_3968_2381/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Bradley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Bradley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c1a59e4b0365be5167ddb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T09:57:35.073Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Jo Swinson gets John Humphrys to admit he has apologised to Carrie Gracie over pay comment</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Last month my colleague Anushka Asthana revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/25/tracey-crouch-john-humphrys-bbc-today-carrie-gracie\">Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, refused to be interviewed by the Today presenter <strong>John Humphrys</strong></a> <strong><br></strong>because he was recorded seeming to joke about Carrie Gracie\u2019s fight for equal pay in a private conversation with his fellow BBC broadcaster Jon Sopel.

At the time Downing Street played down the report, suggesting that something might emerge eventually, but this morning the Commons Treasury committee has released a letter it has had on this topic from <strong>John Glen</strong>, a Treasury minister, confirming that the government is reluctant to publish its thinking. You can read the whole letter <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/Correspondence/2017-19/Letter-Economic-Secretary-brexit-position-020218.pdf\">here (pdf),</a> but here is the key paragraph:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important to be cognisant of the fact that the UK\u2019s intentions for our future relationship with the EU form an integral part of our negotiating strategy. Negotiations are highly sensitive and we want to secure the best possible outcome, including for our financial services industry. In the first phase of negotiations, it was a pragmatic approach that secured us the announcement of sufficient progress. We must carefully consider the timing of any publications that could be used to undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position. </p> </blockquote> <p>In his letter Glen also says the government has been representing the views of the City in Brexit talks with the EU in private \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and that in some areas it has been able to set out what it wants in public. But, overall, on financial services, Glen is coming close to saying that the government cannot say what it wants - because that might stop it getting what it wants.</p> <p><strong>Nicky Morgan,</strong> the pro-European Conservative who chairs the committee, is not impressed. In a statement issued in her capacity as committee chair she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The clock is ticking for the financial services industry. As the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday, businesses need answers urgently on the government\u2019s vision for Brexit so they can prepare for the future with confidence.</p> <p>Many firms will begin to activate their Brexit contingency plans at the end of March, but they\u2019re still none the wiser about the Government\u2019s desired end-state for the sector.</p> <p>By publishing a position paper on financial services, the government could articulate a clear sense of direction and provide some much-needed clarity. Yet, as the economic secretary confirms, the government is refusing to publish such a paper for fear of undermining the UK\u2019s negotiating position.</p> <p>Nothing undermines a negotiating position more than not having one.</p> <p>Clarity has been provided for numerous other sectors, so the more than one million people employed in financial services will take no comfort in the government\u2019s inaction.</p> <p>Financial services firms will be seriously concerned at the chronic state of uncertainty. The government should publish its position paper on the future of financial services immediately.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today is the last day the Commons is sitting before a mini, half-term recess.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday the European commission published a short position paper on the Brexit transition (pdf). As the Guardian reported in a story before the document was formally published, it said that the EU should have the power to penalise the UK during the transition by closing off parts of the single market to British companies if resolving disputes by going to the European court of justice would take too long. The story referred to footnote 4, which said: In addition, the governance and dispute settlement part of the withdrawal agreement should provide for a mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market where it considers that referring the matter to the court of justice of the European Union would not bring in appropriate time the necessary remedies. At the time some commentators downplayed the significance of this, arguing that clauses like this are routine in trade agreements. Bu David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has given an interview today strongly criticising the commission for publishing that document. He said: That document was hardly a legal document, it was a political document. What we\u2019re about, is building an implementation period, which is to build a bridge to a future where we work well together. And I do not think it was in good faith to publish a document with frankly discourteous language, and actually implying that they could arbitrarily terminate, in effect, the implementation period. That\u2019s not what the aim of this exercise is, it\u2019s not in good faith, and we think it\u2019s unwise to publish that. Bad faith is quite a charge. Davis is not just saying the commission made a mistake; he is coming close to saying Michel Barnier, his opposite number, cannot be trusted. It is hard to think of anything that UK government has said about provocative about the EU in public since Theresa May\u2019s Downing Street broadside about interfering Eurocrats during the general election. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said today\u2019s meeting of the key Brexit cabinet sub committee lasted a little more than two hours, but declined to give further details of what was discussed. The Press Association has filed more quotes from Koji Tsuruoka, the Japanese ambassador to the UK. Speaking after he and Japanese business figures met the prime minister, he said said manufacturing firms in particular \u201cexpected\u201d free access to the European market to continue. He said: It\u2019s not just to the UK that we are presenting those positions. Japan has also approached the EU secretariat in Brussels to make the point that the continuation of healthy, sound trade relations between UK and EU is benefitting not just UK but also EU, and hence the global economy as a whole because this is a very important economy that has very important weight in the health of the global economy, and Japan is playing a major role on both sides as a major investor. Therefore we have a high stake on this and I think it\u2019s the recognition of the Japanese importance on this trade area that the prime minister has allocated a considerable amount of time to meet and discuss all aspects of the negotiation with Japanese industry. Tsuruoka said Japanese firms wanted to stay in the UK. Japanese companies are enjoying their operations in the UK and they have also today said they would very much like to continue this successful operation in the UK, which of course is comprised with access to the European market. Therefore the question is whether the arrangements that will be reached between the two sides will allow the Japanese companies, who are willing and in some ways determined to continue to operate in the UK, to allow them to make that happen. This is contingent on a number of factors and there is not just one single factor that will be determining the decision. As Sky\u2019s Faisal Islam reports, while the Japanese business leaders were in Number 10 talking to Theresa May, the Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg turned up to deliver a petition calling for lower aid spending. With a jibe at Peugeot cars, he claimed that Brexit would be good for Japanese business. Senior figures at Holyrood have lambasted the UK government for giving MSPs heavily-controlled access to its preliminary reports on Brexit at very short notice in Edinburgh, a day before Holyrood breaks up for a week\u2019s recess. Ken McIntosh, the Scottish parliament\u2019s presiding officer, told MSPs on Thursday they would be allowed access, after booking time in advance, but without any mobile phones or electronic devices. They could take notes, under the scrutiny of civil servants, but not allowed to take any copies of the documents away. Joan McAlpine, the Scottish National party chair of Holyrood\u2019s Europe committee, tweeted she was \u201cincredulous and angry to receive this\u201d invitation from DexEU on Thursday. Neil Findlay, Scottish Labour\u2019s Brexit spokesperson, said: This is an absolute nonsense, and takes no consideration of MSPs who have constituencies far from Edinburgh - or indeed the fact that Holyrood is sitting at those times on a Thursday. This is the shambolic Tory approach to Brexit summed up. That was followed by Ross Greer, the Scottish Green party\u2019s external affairs spokesperson for the Scottish Greens, said: They\u2019ve chosen to make this information available to MSPs for just twelve hours over two days with no prior notice \u2013 two days in which we have committees, debates and constituency business. It\u2019s like the planning application from the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy - in the cellar, with no lights or stairs and at the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused toilet behind a sign saying Beware Of The Leopard. Except this isn\u2019t fiction. Here is a picture of the roundtable with Japanese business leaders in Number 10. This is from Sky\u2019s Tom Boadle. The Japanese government first set out its concerns about the impact of Brexit on its manufacturing companies based in the UK in a long and very detailed memo (pdf) it issued in September 2016. My colleague Patrick Wintour wrote about it here. This tweet makes the point that the Japanese were worrying about Brexit even in the 1980s - long before the term was even coined. Theresa May\u2019s meeting with Japanese business leaders based in the UK has finished. They were there to talk about Brexit, and afterwards Koji Tsuruoka, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, implied that Japanese companies would leave the UK if Brexit went wrong. He said: If there is no profitability of continuing operation in [the] UK, not Japanese only, no private company can continue operations. So it is as simple as that. And this is all high stakes that I think all of us need to keep in mind. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, goes next. Q: You are harvesting data about people every time they use Facebook, aren\u2019t you? Bickert says she does not accept that. She says Facebook has a system that allows users to see all the information Facebook has on them. Q: Isn\u2019t this a massive surveillance operation? No, says Bickert. It is a means that allows people to keep in touch with each other. Q: The Times today has an article headed: \u201cThe truth about Facebook: how to win 2bn friends and destroy civilisation.\u201d It is by a well-known journalist (John Lanchester.) Bickert says she does not accept that view. Simon Hart, a Conservative, is asking the questions. Q: You allow very targeted advertising. Are you happy that your procedures operate within the rules on election spending? Milner says Facebook has a good relationship with the Electoral Commission. It is up to the parties to determine that they spend the right amount. But he says Facebook accepts the case for transparency. He says it is going to introduce a new system allowing people to see what ads are being placed by parties and candidates. Facebook says it will introduce new system to allow people to see all Facebook adverts being bought by parties and candidates. Milner says, when the Electoral Commission asked Facebook to look into whether Russia used Facebook to intervene in the EU referendum, it asked if anyone had seen anything that looked \u201cfishy\u201d. The commission did not give any examples, he says. Labour\u2019s Julie Elliott goes next. Q: Do you think misinformation on Facebook contributed to the EU referendum result? Milner says the company is still looking into this. It wrote to the committee at the end of last year, but the chair was not satisfied. So it is doing more work. That should be ready by the end of February. But, unlike in the American elections, there is no evidence at the moment of Russian involvement in the EU referendum. Q: The fake accounts you took down - where did they come from? Bickert says Facebook can provide more information in private. Q: What can you do to ensure that people on Facebook are engaged with real people. My son signed up when he was nine. Bickert says Facebook has systems that try to detect when people are putting in false birthdays. And it is constantly working on how to improve identifying fake accounts. There are technical tools that can help Facebook determine if an account is fake. Sometimes it is very simple. But sometimes it is not. Then an account may be referred to a reviewer. The user might be asked to give more information. The Russian embassy in London has posted a tweet having a go at the committee\u2019s inquiry. Labour\u2019s Paul Farrelly goes next. Bickert says Facebook removed thousands of fake accounts ahead of the French, British and German elections. Q: Do you do these sweeps just before specific elections? Bickert says they are doing them all the time. Q: How much of your revenue do you put into dealing with fake content? Monika Bickert, Facebook\u2019s head of global policy management, says she does not have a figure for that. But more than 14,000 people are working on this. She says the revenue for the last quarter was around $14bn. The committee is now taking evidence from Facebook executives. Damian Collins asks the questions. He says, in response to questions about Russian involvement in the EU referendum, Facebook has just looked at rouble payments for advertising. That does not go far enough, he says. Simon Milner, Facebook\u2019s policy director for the UK, Middle East and Africa, says Facebook is currently doing a further investigation. It will share the results with the committee, although possibly in private. Downs says YouTube has started to give users information about news outlets, saying, for example, whether they receive government funding. Q: This puts RT, the Kremlin-backed broadcaster, in the same basket as the BBC. Is that helpful? Downs says YouTube did reach out to the BBC and, in response to the BBC\u2019s feedback, it created two categories: government-funded (RT), and public broadcaster (BBC). Damian Collins says this creates confusion. Downs says the term \u201cfake news\u201d is used to cover a lot of things. At one end of the spectrum you have \u201cfake news\u201d farms. YouTube has mechanism to spot this and remove it. Then you have clickbait content. She says YouTube identifies this and demotes it in its ratings. Then, somewhere in the middle, you have opinions that people express. YouTube does not consider that to be news, she says. But if it violates policy on, for example, hate speech, it will get taken down. The SNP\u2019s Brendan O\u2019Hara goes next. He says the \u201cfairytale idea\u201d of a space where everyone can share has been overtaken by the reality. Q: Do you think the current legislative framework is sufficiently robust? Downs says YouTube welcomes engaging with legislators. But it does not need legislation to get this right. It is working on it already. Q: Google is sucking advertising revenue away from newspapers. What is Google going to do to ensure proper journalism survives? Gingras says that is a very good question. Google\u2019s success depends on there being a rich ecosystem of information out there. He says Google shares 70% of its ad revenues with other publishers. Its revenues are worth $12.5bn a year. He says he started out in newspapers. Q: What happens when the journalistic landscape is so decimated. Do you have a strong sense of responsibility? Gingras says Google has a strong sense of responsibility. It is helping firms make the transition to the new media world. In the past, if you wanted to buy a car, you would go to the paper. Now you go to the internet. The market place has changed, he says. He says Google is trying to help news organisations think about what products it can sell to people. He says it helps with tools for digital storytelling. It trains thousands of journalists in the UK. It is helping people like Trinity Mirror deliver services like InYourArea. Julian Knight, a Conservative, asks about an article in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal. It says you promote misleading material. Downs says the company is continuing investing to give a good experience for users. She says YouTube is not proud of what is exposed by the WSJ investigation. Labour\u2019s Chris Matheson goes next. She returns to the Guardian investigation, and asks why YouTube was recommending Trump videos more than Clinton videos before the US elections. Downs says the algorithms reflect what people are interested in. People watch what they want to watch, she says. Q: If a video is getting hundreds of thousands of hits, but then gets taken down, wouldn\u2019t that be odd for your business model? Downs says the content guidelines apply to all creators, no matter who they are. Downs says YouTube recognises there is a problem of misinformation on its platform. This is a matter of social responsibility. But it is also a business priority, she says. She says people come to YouTube looking f Downs says the veracity of content provided to users is very important to YouTube. Damian Collins says, if YouTube has revenues of $10bn, and is spending $10m on tackling extremism, that is 0.1% of revenue. That is a tiny proportion. Downs says she is not able to say what the revenues are. Collins says the committee would like YouTube to say what proportion of revenue is spent on tackling extremism. Downs says the openness of YouTube has brought tremendous benefits to society, in terms of the arts and science. But it also brings challenges, she says. Rebecca Pow, a Conservative, asks about Guardian research showing how YouTube recommend system promotes false and far-right videos. Downs says she does not want to comment on the Guardian research. But YouTube wants to promote accurate videos, she says. She says the company has made progress since the US election. Now it is doing better at promoting accurate comment. Q: In promoting videos, you are acting as an editor. But you do not call what you do editing. Shouldn\u2019t you accept that you are editing? Downs says YouTube has 400 hours of video uploaded every minute. As for whether they are a publisher, the issue is whether they take responsibility for what they are putting on their site. They do, she says. Damian Collins goes next. Q: Why is it so hard identifying false data? Downs says this is the number one priority for the company. It is mission critical. It want to ensure policy on YouTube is followed, and videos not following it are quickly identified. Q: What percentage of your revenue do you spend on this? Downs says the company is spending tens of millions of dollars on this. She says YouTube has taken down 100,000 videos because they promote violent extremism. And it is getting faster at removing stuff. Some 70% is removed within eight hours of being uploaded, and 15% within two hours of being uploaded. Q: If someone is uploading these videos, do you share that information with law enforcement? Downs says YouTube operates within the law. If there is a threat to life, it discloses information voluntarily. Q: Haven\u2019t you got a duty to notify the law enforcement authorities pro-actively? Downs says, if it thinks someone is going to launch an attack, it will notify the authorities as part of its emergency protocol. Labour\u2019s Ian Lucas goes next. Q: Do your customers know what information you have about them? Gingras says he hopes so. People can change their settings, to change what information is retained. But he says the information allows Google to provide them with better information. He says Google search does not personalise search results, unless it is by geography (for instance, if someone is looking for a restaurant in London.) Q: Do you have a team that markets advertising to politicians? Gingras says that is not an area of expertise for him. He expects their marketing teams do focus on certain areas. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens goes next. Q: What safeguards are you putting in place to stop hate terms coming up in auto-suggest when people search for something? Richard Gingras, vice president of news at Google, says Google constantly evaluates how is results are assessed. Those hundreds of thousands of bits of data are used to train the system, he says. But the algorithms will never be perfect. Q: Do you have an ethics policy that your developers follower? Or do inherent biases shape their algorithm? Gingras says Google has guidelines for its \u201craiders\u201d, who work on this. He says Google has a policy called \u201chonest results\u201d intended to stop people at the company algorithms. Damian Collins, the committee chair, is asking the questions. Q: Would you be happy to investigate whether there was any Russian interference on your platform in the EU referendum? Juniper Downs, global head of policy at YouTube, says there is no evidence of Russian interference in that. But she says YouTube would be happy to cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation. The committee has already published correspondence it has received from Twitter and Facebook in response to its inquiries. The letters are all on its website here. Here are the questions the committee said it wanted to address when it launched its inquiry. What is \u2018fake news\u2019? Where does biased but legitimate commentary shade into propaganda and lies? What impact has fake news on public understanding of the world, and also on the public response to traditional journalism? If all views are equally valid, does objectivity and balance lose all value? Is there any difference in the way people of different ages, social backgrounds, genders etc use and respond to fake news? Have changes in the selling and placing of advertising encouraged the growth of fake news, for example by making it profitable to use fake news to attract more hits to websites, and thus more income from advertisers? The Commons culture committee is about to take evidence from Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter as part of its inquiry into \u201cfake news\u201d. The hearing is taking place at George Washington University in Washington DC and you will be able to watch it here. It is the first live broadcast of a Commons select committee hearing taking place outside the UK. Hospitals recorded their worst performance against the four-hour A&amp;E treatment target last month as the NHS came under unprecedented strain because of winter and the flu outbreak. Nicky Morgan, the chair of the Commons Treasury committee, has accused the government of leaving the City in a \u201cchronic state of uncertainty\u201d after the Treasury said it was holding back publication of its paper on the future of financial services because it did not want to undermine its Brexit negotiating position. \u201cNothing undermines a negotiating position more than not having one,\u201d Morgan said. (See 9.24am.) The Bank of England has put borrowers on notice for an interest rate hike earlier than expected, stoking expectations for an increase as early as May, as the economy accelerates with help from booming global growth. Labour has accused the government of \u201ccomplacency\u201d over violent crime following the publication of four new reports showing significant increases in some areas. (See 10.44am.) Commenting on the figures, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: The rise in homicides is deeply troubling. With the police now dealing with over a million violent offences a year, there can be no room for complacency about rising violent crime. And yet the Tories have attempted to dismiss rising crime data as all due to better police recording. This cannot be the case with homicides. MPs and peers could face recall or expulsion under new sanctions aimed at combating the widespread bullying and sexual harassment uncovered in a cross-party report. The government has come under cross-party pressure to explain why it gave permission for Bermuda to repeal same-sex marriage rights, after the British territory became the first place in the world to make such a move. Esther McVey, the work and pensions secretary, has told MPs that she has asked the National Audit Office to consider investigating Motability, the disability charity. In response to reports it has a \u00a32.4bn surplus and pays its chief executive \u00a31.7m a year, McVey told MPs: As we have seen in so many instances, what was deemed correct in the 1970s isn\u2019t necessarily correct by today\u2019s standards. With the current focus on corporate governance issues and the use of public money, I have today asked the National Audit Office to give consideration to undertake an investigation into this matter. I would be keen for the NAO to look at how taxpayers\u2019 money is being used by Motability. McVey also said the charity has done \u201cmuch good\u201d since being established 40 years ago but it must \u201clisten to the criticisms it has faced\u201d and be \u201creceptive to change\u201d. A Tory donor has paid \u00a355,000 to spend a day with Theresa May, in an auction at the party\u2019s annual Black and White fundraising ball. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has announced that the government is considering a ban on the sale of puppies in pet shops, and unveiled measures to crack down on unscrupulous puppy breeders. The government has launched a consultation on details of the legislation setting up Social Work England, its new regulator for social workers. Jeremy Corbyn has called on the Russian Football Union and Fifa to take immediate action against anyone caught committing racist acts at this summer\u2019s World Cup. Speaking to primary school children at a Show Racism the Red Card event at Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium (he\u2019s a fan of the club), he said he hoped the tournament is remembered for events on the pitch rather than in the stands. He said: Anyone that commits acts of racist abuse in this club, or any other, are asked to leave the stadium straight away, and that\u2019s how it should be. I hope that in the World Cup this summer in Russia the authorities, Fifa, make sure that is the case in every stadium all through the World Cup. We want the World Cup to be brilliant as an exhibition of football, not of blind prejudice to each other. Here is my colleague Denis Campbell and Pamela Duncan\u2019s story about the A&amp;E waiting time figures. NHS England has released its A&amp;E performance data for January (pdf). The figures show that 85.3% of A&amp;E patients were seen within four hours. That is well below the 95% target, but marginally higher than the figure for December (85.1%), or for January 2017 (also 85.1%). For major A&amp;E departments the figure was 77.1% - the lowest figure since these statistics started to be collected in this way in 2010. In December the figure was 77.3% and in January 2017 it was 77.6%. The figures also show that 1,043 A&amp;E patients had to wait more than 12 hours to be seen in January - again, the worst figures since the records began. Commenting on the figures, Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: Today\u2019s statistics expose the hollow nature of the prime minister\u2019s claim that her government has sufficiently prepared for winter. Almost eight years of severe austerity has left our health service woefully underfunded, understaffed and unprepared for the rise in demand during the coldest period of the year. This January was the worst month on record for major A&amp;Es, with over 1,000 patients being stuck on trolleys for over 12 hours and a staggering 515% increase in those waiting over 4 hours compared with January 2011. Theresa May is chairing another meeting of the cabinet\u2019s key Brexit sub committee - the EU exit and trade (strategy and negotiations) sub committee, to give it its full name - this morning. Yesterday\u2019s meeting did not seem to produce any firm decisions. Here is our overnight story. And here is some of the coverage of yesterday\u2019s meeting in other papers and websites. Gordon Rayner in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) says ministers are a \u201cmillion miles\u201d away from an agreement on Brexit. One source said: \u201cThere is mounting concern that nothing has been agreed yet. No-one seems to know when this is going to be sorted out. \u201cThere has been talk of the cabinet being taken away to Chequers to thrash out an agreement on what kind of trade deal we want and how we solve the Northern Ireland issue, but nothing has been arranged. \u201cAt the moment it feels like the cabinet is a million miles away from agreeing a position.\u201d Another source said: \u201cThe cabinet is closer to agreeing a position on transition than it is to agreeing on the end state. \u201cThere are some pretty substantial divisions between different members of the Cabinet on the sort of Brexit we are pursuing, and it doesn\u2019t seem as though any of them are going to undergo a Damascene conversion any time soon.\u201d Oliver Wright, Francis Elliott and Catherine Philip in the Times (paywall) says the government is not likely to give EU nationals preferential rights over other foreigners after Brexit. EU citizens would have no more right to come and work in Britain than those of any other country under plans presented to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit war cabinet yesterday. In a proposal that risks further inflaming tensions with Brussels, several ministers backed the plan for a \u201clevel playing field\u201d immigration system to be introduced after Brexit. The idea was one of two options for a reformed immigration system presented to the meeting by Olly Robbins, Mrs May\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. While no vote was taken and Mrs May herself did not express a view, one source suggested it was now the most likely option for the government to pursue. \u201cLevel playing field is certainly in the ascendancy,\u201d the source said. The Times also says yesterday\u2019s sub committee meeting did not come to a conclusion. One source said that Mrs May asked members of the Brexit sub-committee to respond to Mr Robbins\u2019s presentation but did not express a view herself. \u201cThe discussions never got into the weeds,\u201d they said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any rows but that was because there was no attempt to come to any conclusion.\u201d George Parker and Alex Barker in the Financial Times (paywall) also say there was no agreement yesterday. One person briefed on Wednesday\u2019s meeting said: \u201cThere was no breakthrough on Northern Ireland, more that they needed to think about it some more. They also say ministers are split over what to do about Ireland. Before the meeting, one pro-Brexit minister said the Treasury had been \u201cscaremongering\u201d about a possible return of strife to Northern Ireland, to push Mrs May towards a \u201csoft\u201d Brexit and possible extension of a customs union. \u201cThere are people saying that because the Northern Ireland question is insuperable, you have to have common standards and full alignment,\u201d said the minister. \u201cIt\u2019s absolute rubbish.\u201d Tom McTague and Charlie Cooper at Politico Europe say the cabinet sub committee is looking at a plan that would see the UK diverging from the EU immediately after Brexit in some areas. The outlines of the long-awaited plan, which will be discussed by a Brexit sub-committee of May\u2019s Cabinet Thursday and are expected to be signed off by the full Cabinet over the coming weeks, envisages the U.K. diverging from a series of key EU rules and regulations \u201cimmediately\u201d after the end of any Brexit transition period while retaining the power to go further in other areas at a later stage, according to senior British officials. One official named three areas where the government wants to diverge after Brexit: agricultural subsidies currently administered under the Common Agricultural Policy, financial services regulation and trade policy. Another official agreed these three policy areas were being discussed and said imposing restrictions on freedom of movement was also an imperative for the government, as was the desire to spend money recouped from the EU budget on public services such as the NHS. Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, was added to the Brexit sub committee to help Theresa May counter Boris Johnson. A senior Tory MP told The Sun: \u201cTheresa can\u2019t\u2019 trust Gavin [Williamson, the defence secretary, another member of the sub committee] any more as he\u2019s out for himself, so she needs someone she can rely on. Hence, Karen. \u201cShe is her mistress\u2019s voice, which looks like she might be ready to take on Boris and Gove.\u201d Labour MPs are in Belfast today to support calls from Amnesty International and the Family Planning Association for the reform of the near total ban on abortion in Northern Ireland. The MPs said they will attempt to introduce legislation to legalise abortion in Northern Irish hospitals if local politicians fail to reach an agreement at the talks aimed at restoring devolved power sharing government. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply. Thousands of women from the region have over the years been forced to travel to Britain to terminate their pregnancies. A number of local women are currently facing prosecution for obtaining abortion pills on the Internet. Successive British governments have refused to impose abortion reform on the region arguing that any decision to liberalise the law on terminations should be a devolved matter. Attempts in the Northern Ireland assembly over the last decade to relax the strict anti-abortion laws in the province have been voted down by a cross party alliance of the Democratic Unionists and even by some representatives from the Labour party-aligned SDLP. Ahead of a meeting with assembly members as well as Amnesty International and health care professionals in Belfast, Labour\u2019s Northern Ireland spokesman Owen Smith said: We believe that this is a decision that should be made in Stormont by a returned Stormont assembly and executive and we will continue to do all we can to see the return of devolution. However, if power returns to Westminster, we will push the government to make progress on ensuring people in Northern Ireland have the same rights as those elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The Office for National Statistics has published four reports today covering different types of violent crime. In a statement the ONS\u2019s John Flatley said measuring crime was complex. He said: The data we\u2019ve published today show the complexity of measuring crime in all its different forms. Even offences under the heading of \u2018violence\u2019 vary enormously, from minor assaults such as pushing and shoving to homicide. We need to be careful that our perceptions and understanding of crime levels are shaped by appropriate data, and not over-generalised. Here is the report on violent crime. Here is the report on homicide. Here is the report on sexual offences. And here is the report on domestic abuse offences. Roundtable talks between the five parties represented in the currently deadlocked Northern Ireland Assembly have been postponed, it was announced today. A planned plenary session of the negotiations has been put back until Friday while Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley is allowed to attend the crucial Bexit cabinet sub committee meeting on Brexit in London. There are reports in Belfast today that there has been some progress made between the two main parties locked in the discussions - the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein. Sources close to the talks claim that a deal to restore power sharing devolved government could happen within days. They claim there has been some movement on the divisive issue of Sinn Fein\u2019s demand for an Irish Language Act, which would put Gaelic on the same legal parity as English across the region. Under this fledgling deal Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, would return as first minister of Northern Ireland. This would mark a shift in Sinn Fein\u2019s position from 13 months ago. The talks broke down at the start of 2017 after the late Martin McGuinness resigned in protest as deputy first minister. He stood down from the post and effectively crashed the power sharing system because first minister Foster refused to temporarily step aside from her post. Foster had been under pressure to do so as criticism mounted over her promotion of a renewable green energy scheme that has cost the tax payer tens of millions of pounds. Both the British and Irish governments - both on and off the record - continue to paint a positive picture of the crucial discussions between Sinn Fein and the DUP. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said today that he \u201cremained convinced\u201d that an agreement can and will be reached. One key factor in Sinn Fein seeking a compromise with the DUP is the appointment of a new leader this weekend. Dublin politician Mary Lou McDonald will replace Gerry Adams as Sinn Fein President this Saturday marking a generational shift within the high command of the party. A power-sharing deal, which would be welcomed among all political classes on both these islands, would be seen as giving a boost to the credentials of the McDonald-led Sinn Fein, particularly among southern Irish voters who until now have been repelled by the party\u2019s historic links to the IRA\u2019s armed campaign during the Northern Ireland Troubles. Last month my colleague Anushka Asthana revealed that the Tracey Crouch, the sports minister, refused to be interviewed by the Today presenter John Humphrys because he was recorded seeming to joke about Carrie Gracie\u2019s fight for equal pay in a private conversation with his fellow BBC broadcaster Jon Sopel. Anushka said other female MPs were angry about Humphrys\u2019s comment and also mulling over a boycott. This morning Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem deputy leader, got the chance to challenge Humphrys about his remark herself. At the end of an interview about the new Commons procedures for dealing with harassment, she asked her own question. While I have got you here John, can I just ask have you apologised to Carrie Gracey for the remarks that you made about her courageous stance on equal pay? In response Humphrys said he had apologised. He replied: I wrote an email to Carrie Gracie immediately after that exchange, yes I did as a matter of fact, and she replied. Quite what this has to do with what we are discussing here I fail to see, but there we are. Humphrys did not sound particularly flustered as he replied, but he did not seem very happy about the matter being raised either. Later he described Swinson\u2019s question as \u201centirely irrelevant\u201d. Last month it was reported that the government had shelved a position paper it was expected to publish about financial services after Brexit. At the time Downing Street played down the report, suggesting that something might emerge eventually, but this morning the Commons Treasury committee has released a letter it has had on this topic from John Glen, a Treasury minister, confirming that the government is reluctant to publish its thinking. You can read the whole letter here (pdf), but here is the key paragraph: It is important to be cognisant of the fact that the UK\u2019s intentions for our future relationship with the EU form an integral part of our negotiating strategy. Negotiations are highly sensitive and we want to secure the best possible outcome, including for our financial services industry. In the first phase of negotiations, it was a pragmatic approach that secured us the announcement of sufficient progress. We must carefully consider the timing of any publications that could be used to undermine the UK\u2019s negotiating position. In his letter Glen also says the government has been representing the views of the City in Brexit talks with the EU in private \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and that in some areas it has been able to set out what it wants in public. But, overall, on financial services, Glen is coming close to saying that the government cannot say what it wants - because that might stop it getting what it wants. Nicky Morgan, the pro-European Conservative who chairs the committee, is not impressed. In a statement issued in her capacity as committee chair she said: The clock is ticking for the financial services industry. As the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday, businesses need answers urgently on the government\u2019s vision for Brexit so they can prepare for the future with confidence. Many firms will begin to activate their Brexit contingency plans at the end of March, but they\u2019re still none the wiser about the Government\u2019s desired end-state for the sector. By publishing a position paper on financial services, the government could articulate a clear sense of direction and provide some much-needed clarity. Yet, as the economic secretary confirms, the government is refusing to publish such a paper for fear of undermining the UK\u2019s negotiating position. Nothing undermines a negotiating position more than not having one. Clarity has been provided for numerous other sectors, so the more than one million people employed in financial services will take no comfort in the government\u2019s inaction. Financial services firms will be seriously concerned at the chronic state of uncertainty. The government should publish its position paper on the future of financial services immediately. Today is the last day the Commons is sitting before a mini, half-term recess. We have got various written statements coming. And one is already out, covering the report on new procedures to tackle sexual harassment at Westminster. Here is our story about it. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Theresa May chairs another meeting of the cabinet\u2019s key Brexit sub committee where ministers will discuss what relationship they want with the EU after Brexit. 1pm: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, speaks at a Labour conference in Preston. 2pm: The Commons culture committee takes evidence from tech and internet companies at a hearing in Washington DC. 4.30pm: Andrea Leadsom, leader of the Commons, takes part in an LBC phone-in. At some point today May is also holding a meeting at Number 10 with Japanese investors in the UK to discuss Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon. You can read all today\u2019s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019 top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don\u2019t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter",

Reviving old antisemitic conspiracy theories, Russian media, for example, has not hesitated to focus on Soros\u2019s Jewish background: with state-funded broadcaster RT tweeting in 2016 that he \u201cdid not get his pound of flesh, this time\u201d. In the US, alt-right campaigners opposed to HR McMaster also used a cartoon showing Trump\u2019s national security adviser being manipulated by puppet masters labelled \u201cSoros\u201d and \u201cRothschilds\u201d (the original \u201cRothschilds\u201d label was later changed to \u201cSaudis\u201d after complaints of antisemitism.) In Britain, the pro-Brexit campaign Leave.EU has tweeted drawings portraying the Labour MP David Lammy as a puppet with his strings controlled by Soros, and labelled the financier\u2019s philanthropic operations \u201cThe Soros Web\u201d.",

Hulot, 62, denied what he called \u201cshameful\u201d rumours when he appeared on a French TV show on Thursday. \u201cIt hurts, when it\u2019s wrongful and unfounded,\u201d said the celebrity environmentalist, one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s most popular ministers. He said of the alleged assault: \u201cI was questioned at my own request and investigators very quickly concluded that there was nothing suggesting the case should be followed up.\u201d The magazine also claimed that a former worker at Hulot\u2019s environment foundation had spoken about sexual harassment, which Hulot also denied. The woman, when contacted by the magazine, also \u201ccompletely denied\u201d having spoken about sexual harassment. Hulot said he had not considered resigning. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, issued a statement of support, saying Hulot\u2019s explanations had been \u201cclear and precise and we have no reason to doubt his word\u201d. Last month, another member of Macron\u2019s government, the budget minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin, was accused of rape. Paris prosecutors reopened an investigation into Darmanin after a woman alleged that he had pressured her into sex in 2009 in exchange for helping clear her name in a legal dispute. Darmanin\u2019s lawyers accused her of trying to harm his reputation and said he would sue for slander. Other ministers supported Darmanin, saying that at this stage he had not been charged with any crime. Philippe said Darmanin still had his full confidence. A group of French feminists has launched a petition calling on the prime minister to sack Darmanin.",

However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. </p> <p>Anyway, what if the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u2019s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u2019s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7c7d82e4b05abd28aabd7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T16:41:14.334Z\">4.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Lavorgnanomics/status/961639300327763968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Catalyst for today\u2019s sell off?

In addition, the November rate hike is still working its way through the economy and there are signs that the pace of slowing in the housing market has accelerated, with mortgage approvals dropping sharply in December and the Halifax house price index falling for two consecutive months.</p> <p>In our view, this provides sufficient reason for caution.

It now expects 1.8% growth this year, as against 1.6% forecast in November. Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u2019s rhetoric echoed that of September\u2019s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike.</p> <p>It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u2013 the next time the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts are due to be updated.

However, this week Bill Dudley, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, dismissed the stock market sell-off as being of little consequence to central bankers. Meanwhile Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told the Financial Times that market volatility could be healthy and that he was sticking with his forecast of three rate hikes in 2018. So, the implication is that it would take a lot more than a doubling of volatility and a 1,000-point sell-off to throw the Fed off its current path of monetary tightening. Anyway, what if the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening in the form of rate increases and balance sheet reduction is going to happen anyway, no matter what the inflation and growth outlook? What if the Fed is thinking ahead to the next recession and is desperate to build up ammunition for when it must slash rates again in response? Also, this market was already selling off on the back of rising bond yields before Friday\u2019s rout. In the space of a month the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note had risen from below 2.5% to close to 2.9%. While this week\u2019s sell-off in equities saw yields drop back sharply as investors sought out safety of US Treasuries, the 10-year yield is once again approaching 2.9% and giving every indication the new key level of 3.0% is about to be tested. If so, then we can expect global equities to take another hit as investors panic about the prospect of higher rates on highly leveraged and over-indebted markets. One Wall Street economist points to the earlier US jobless claims as a reason for the Wall Street slide: The VIX volatility index is also higher, up around 6% at 29.41 although it is still well below the 50 level it reached earlier in the week. Markets continue to be spooked by the prospect of higher interest rates and the removal of the wall of money provided by central banks since the financial crisis. The Bank of England\u2019s more hawkish tone has only served to reinforce the view that rates are going to continue rising. The market falls are accelerating again. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 220 points or 0.9%. The FTSE 100 has fallen just over 1%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.3% and France\u2019s Cac is 1% lower. The prospect of a UK rate rise continues to support the pound, which is up just over 1% against the dollar at $1.4030. In turn, the FTSE 100 remains in the red, packed as it is with overseas earners which benefit from a weaker sterling. At the moment it is down more than 1%, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is 1.2% lower. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: Both the FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 took Thursday\u2019s notice that rates were on the up as negative and traded lower. However, further out, we expect recent evidence of a weakened pound/stocks correlation to become clearer. This should enable equities to participate in the return to the \u2018new normal\u2019 for UK markets as well. Back with the Bank of England and the suggestion of a May interest rate rise, economist Daniel Vernazza at UniCredit Bank is not entirely convinced: We retain our forecast for the MPC to remain on hold this year, largely because we expect economic activity and inflation to be weaker than the BoE expects. The main uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is how businesses and households react to progress in Brexit negotiations. On the one hand, any resolution of Brexit-related uncertainty is likely to boost confidence and demand On the other hand, any progress on Brexit negotiations will not become binding until ratified as part of the whole \u201cwithdrawal agreement\u201d, which won\u2019t be until Spring next year, and meanwhile the impact of uncertainty could increase as the potential cliff-edge of 29 March 2019 draws nearer and businesses act on their contingency plans. In addition, the November rate hike is still working its way through the economy and there are signs that the pace of slowing in the housing market has accelerated, with mortgage approvals dropping sharply in December and the Halifax house price index falling for two consecutive months. In our view, this provides sufficient reason for caution. But, as we have previously flagged \u2013 and in light of today\u2019s \u201chawkish\u201d Inflation Report \u2013 the risks are increasingly skewed towards an earlier hike, possibly as soon as May. After Wall Street\u2019s last minute drop into negative territory last night, US markets are on the back foot once more. With bond prices falling and yields continuing to rise, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 100 points or 0.46% in early trading. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.04% lower while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.23%. There has been increasing talk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates by four times this year, more times than previously expected. But Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said: The public should heed the Bank\u2019s warning that rates will probably rise soon, says Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk: \u201cThe base rate may have remained the same today, however borrowers and savers should remain alert. \u201cThe word on the street suggests rate rises may be seen on the horizon for later in the year so now is the time to shop around with your borrowing and lock in your fixed deals at a low rate. \u201cThe previous rate rise meant some people now pay more on their mortgage. Homeowners on variable rate deals should check whether they could save money by switching to a fixed rate or, if you have significant savings, offset mortgage; this may give you some protection against subsequent rate hikes and the difference could be thousands so it\u2019s worth exploring.\u201d Over to the US, and earlier there were more signs of a stronger economy with the latest weekly jobless claims. The number of Americans claiming benefits fell unexpectedly last week by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000. Analysts were forecasting an increase to 232,000. Here\u2019s a quick wrap-up of the Bank of England\u2019s press conference, after it voted to leave UK interest rates unchanged. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that UK interest rates are not heading back to pre-crisis levels, despite hinting that borrowing costs will be hiked soon. Carney insisted that interest rate rises will be gradual and limited, and that borrowing costs won\u2019t hit the 5% level. But he also reiterated that the UK is running out of \u2018spare capacity\u2019, creating pressure to raise borrowing costs. In order to bring it (inflation) back to target over a more conventional horizon which means moving it in from that three year horizon that it will be necessary, likely to be necessary,to raise interest rates to a limited degree in a gradual process but somewhat earlier and to a somewhat greater extent than we thought in November.\u201d Carney warned that UK inflation could rise over 3% in the near term, but also offered optimism that wages will rise this year. The Bank has also hiked its growth forecasts a little for the next few years. The governor was sanguine about the recent market turmoil, pointing out that volatility had been unusually low recently. On Brexit, the governor pointed out that there have been benefits and costs... Investment is being restrained by Brexit related uncertainties. This remains the shallowest investment recovery in the UK for more than half a century. British exporters are in a sweet spot with sterling down 16% overall and around 20% against the euro in anticipation of a Brexit that has not yet happened.\u201d He also made a plea for those making forecasts about Brexit to release their underlying methodology and assumptions, so they can be properly interrogated. Carney refused to agree that interest rates are likely to rise in May, as many forecasts expect. But traders are already reacting. The pound has now jumped almost two cents today, to $1.4060. Government bond yields have weakened, though, while the FTSE 100 is down 0.8% or 60 points lower at 7219. City Index market analyst Fiona Cincotta explains: Whilst policy makers at the Bank of England are unlikely to be considering 3 or 4 hikes this year, the possibility of two hikes across 2018 appears to be increasing. This brings forward the possibility of interest rates being hiked as early as the Spring with May being the most likely month, then an additional increase potentially in November. As the pound has strengthen, the FTSE has come under increased pressure. A stronger pound is less favourable for the international firms that make up 70% of the FTSE. Banks are one of the few sectors to move higher on the FTSE, as they stand to benefit from a higher interest rate environment. Perhaps a May hike is not nailed on: Jeremy Cook of World First has neatly summed up the Bank\u2019s new forecasts: Q: Are you worried that Brexit will undermine confidence in economic forecasting - as any assumptions you make tend to look political. Mark Carney says that forecasters need to be \u201ctransparent, up front\u201d about the assumptions that underpin any Brexit forecasts. He also says it\u2019s important to release the model used when, say, comparing the impact of different trading relationships on the economy, along with the underlying assumptions. That means that people can \u2018interrogate\u2019 them. Brexit forecasts are a big issue in Britain today, after the government\u2019s secret analysis was leaked. The governor then argues that some of the excitement over economic forecasts has been \u201coverplayed\u201d. They can\u2019t be compared to weather forecasts -- unlike weather forecasters, we help make the weather, he points out. Carney concludes: The big picture there is something in these forecasts that tell people about how the economy is going to respond. But the challenge will come over the next year, when policymakers and the public become \u201ca lot better informed\u201d about Brexit. The bank, he pledges, will be \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d about its forecasts, to provide a reference point to help us all understand the situation. The press conference is now over. Fidelity International\u2019s global economist is not impressed by the Bank: The chief economist at the EY Item Club is not changing his rate forecasts despite today\u2019s hawkishness from the Bank: Q: When you raised rates in November, you said you expected banks to pass it on. But many savers haven\u2019t seen the benefits.... Mark Carney says the pass-through has been similar to previous rate increases. Q: Little seems to have changed between November\u2019s inflation report and today\u2019s one, so why are you so much more hawkish? Mark Carney denies that little has changed -- today\u2019s forecasts is \u201cslightly stronger\u201d. But the future path of interest rates depends how the economy develops. Q: What\u2019s your take on the recent turmoil in the markets? Mark Carney says he won\u2019t give a running commentary, but points out that he and other policymakers have recently observed that volatility was extremely low. It is healthier when markets have two-way risks around prices, the governor explains. He doesn\u2019t want to say the recent jump in volatility is welcome, but it\u2019s \u201cnot an entirely surprising development\u201d. Q: Would there be a material impact on your forecasts if Britain and the EU don\u2019t agree a transition deal by the end of March? Fair question, Mark Carney replies. It all depends on the impact on consumer confidence, business confidence and activity -- and whether a transition deal was agreed later than March, or not at all. Our forecasts is based on two Brexit factors - that there is \u201ca smooth transition\u201d, and that it leads to an \u201caverage of potential outcomes\u2019, Carney says. Q: Is there a chance you\u2019re being too pessimistic about productivity, governor? Recent figures have shown it picking up (which would remove some pressure to raise interest rates) Carney says there is a risk either way, joking that the Bank has been \u201cmaking the case\u201d for a pick-up in productivity, but the economy hasn\u2019t played ball. Another clip from today\u2019s report: Good point..... Q: Will making companies report their gender pay gap help to fix this problem? Yes, Mark Carney replies. Extra transparency should force organisations and individuals to think about this issue and bring in policies to fix it. On a personal level, Carney says the Bank has found that it gets \u201cbetter judgements\u201d when there is more diversity. This message is slightly undermined by the fact that today\u2019s press conference has a certain \u2018male, pale\u2019 feel to it: Carney insists the BoE is making progress. Thirty percent of senior managers are women, up from 20% five years ago. Q: Household consumption has fallen since the referendum, productivity is low, Brexit is causing uncertainty, and the markets went into meltdown this week -- so is this really a good time to wean the UK off cheap money? Mark Carney says some of these problems are linked. For example, Britain\u2019s productivity problems mean the economy can\u2019t grow as fast as it used to without generating inflation. The speed limit of the economy has changed. It\u2019s lower. And UK household spending is being driven by incomes, not debt -- so as real wages fall, people have had less money to spend. The governor then defends the Bank\u2019s stimulus measures - saying it has helped the economy ride out the storms. We have been providing a significant amount of support to this economy during very difficult periods. That\u2019s one of the reasons unemployment is at a 40-year low, with more people in work than ever before. It\u2019s one of the reasons why some adjustment of policy is necessary. Bad news for households: Mark Carney has warned that inflation could accelerate again in the next few months. During today\u2019s press conference, he said: It\u2019s possible that inflation could rise back above 3%, temporarily, in the short term. That\u2019s due to higher import prices caused by the weak pound, he added. Q: Many experts are saying that an May interest rate rise is now \u2018in play\u2019. Are they correct? Carney repeats that he won\u2019t be tied down. He then embarks on a long explanation about how market expectations have evolved in recent months, as the spare capacity within the UK economy has been used up. But the degree, and the exact timing, of interest rate rises, depends on how the economy develops. Carney then points to the European Union issue, saying \u201cThis is a crucial year for the Brexit negotiations. We will all be better informed by this time next year about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, he adds -- the impact could be positive, negative or neutral, though. Q: The markets think interest rates will be 1.25% by the start of 2020 - do you agree? Mark Carney says the Bank won\u2019t tie its hands. But he says people need to remember that the current interest rate cycles will be unlike those of the past. If you look before the financial crisis, bank rate was 5% on average, says Carney, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about going back to those levels.....And we\u2019re not talking about going at that pace [as seen in previous cycles]. Asked about the government\u2019s Brexit scenarios, Carney says that business are reacting to the uncertainty. Households, though, are reacting to the squeeze in their real incomes - rather than Brexit\u2019s long-term effects, the governor says. Q: Are you warning us that interest rates are going to rise faster than we thought? Our message is that, if the economy evolves broadly as expected, interest rates will likely rise \u201csomewhat sooner, and to a somewhat greater extent\u201d than forecast in November, Carney clarifies. But it will still be a gradual process, with rates rising to a limited extent, he insists. On Brexit... Carney says the Bank has been setting monetary policy to balance its inflation targeting while protecting jobs and growth. It will keep doing that through the ups and downs in the financial markets, and the \u2018twists and turns\u2019 of Brexit. Good news for workers -- Mark Carney says the Bank is increasingly confident that growth in wages and unit labour costs will pick up. Carney gets to the key message - the Bank of England thinks there is very little spare capacity in the UK economy. That\u2019s why the BoE thinks that monetary policy will be tightened \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it expected three months ago. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, begins the press conference - with deputy governors Ben Broadbent and Dave Ramsden. Carney says it\u2019s 25 years since the Bank first created an inflation report. The backdrop to today\u2019s report is that the global economy is strong. And that\u2019s helping Britain -- net trade is contributing substantially to the UK economy British exporters are in a \u201csweet spot\u201d, with a lower currency helping them sell overseas, Carney continues. But....business investment is being held back by Brexit uncertainty. It\u2019s growing, but much weaker than in previous economic cycles -- the shallowest recovery in 50 years. The Bank of England is holding a press conference now to discuss today\u2019s interest rate decision, and the latest quarterly inflation report. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, predicts there will be at least one UK interest rate rise this year - and possibly two or three. \u201cInflation remains significantly above target and will only fall back gradually as we move through this year, as the Bank of England recognises in its latest forecasts. Global inflationary pressures are building - with rising energy and food prices. And with the unemployment rate at its lowest level for over forty years, we could see some gradual rise in wage inflation. Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency markets analyst at Caxton, says speculation of a May rate hike is building. \u201cThe pound has rallied sharply towards 1.40 against the dollar and 1.14 against the euro after the BoE raised its economic growth and inflation projections and said it may need to increase rates earlier and to a \u201cgreater extent\u201d than thought in November. While markets had been pricing in a hike in November, speculation has been building recently that the BoE could move as soon as May, and today\u2019s hawkish language shift will likely increase that speculation. A rate hike earlier in the year could help the pound maintain higher levels, but Brexit negotiations and political uncertainty remain a significant risk. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says there are some \u201ckey takeaways\u201d in the Bank of England\u2019s new inflation report: Firstly, the expected \u2013 a unanimous vote to leave interest rates on hold for now. The Bank raised borrowing costs for the first time in a decade in November, and as such was fully expected to wait until later this year before considering a further upward move. However, the Bank upgraded its forecast for the UK economy slightly today, citing stronger global conditions. It now expects 1.8% growth this year, as against 1.6% forecast in November. Policymakers also said they will try and bring inflation back to their 2% target more quickly than previously, which means rates could rise faster and further than investors had expected. The Bank\u2019s rhetoric echoed that of September\u2019s meeting minutes, which preceded the November rate hike. It now looks like the next rise could happen as soon as May \u2013 the next time the Bank\u2019s economic forecasts are due to be updated. Prior to today\u2019s announcement, markets were factoring in a 50% chance of a rate rise in May, and an 80% chance they\u2019ll be higher by the end of the year. You can read the minutes of this week\u2019s Bank of England meeting online, here. Here\u2019s a flavour, explaining why the MPC left rates on hold: On the upside, momentum in global growth might persist for longer and the boost to UK demand from global factors could prove greater than anticipated. Global inflationary pressures had also shown signs of building. The tightness of the domestic labour market could result in faster wage and unit labour cost growth. The predicted pickup in productivity growth was not assured. On the downside, some business survey indicators of output had weakened. Recent housing and retail sales data had softened and, more generally, consumers might still respond to the past squeeze in real incomes to a greater degree than anticipated. And UK net trade could benefit by less from the pickup in global demand than had been the case recently. There was a possibility that the contribution of imported inflation pressures would diminish more rapidly than in the central projection. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, predicts that the next UK interest rate hike could come in May. \u201cIf the UK improves on wage growth and unemployment rates remain stable, then it\u2019s almost certain that the MPC will rethink their strategy in Q2. It\u2019s \u2018as you were\u2019 for now but, pending Brexit developments in the new few months, don\u2019t be surprised to see Mark Carney take the plunge and raise interest rates for only the second time in a decade come May.\u201d UK government debt is also weakening, sending Britain\u2019s borrowing costs to their highest level in over a year. The pound has jumped by a whole cent against the US dollar, following the Bank of England\u2019s unexpectedly hawkish announcement. It\u2019s now trading just below $1.40. The Bank of England has also raised its growth forecasts - predicting that the economy will expand faster than expected over the next couple of years. The Bank of England has warned that interest rates may rise sooner than previously expected. In the minutes of today\u2019s meeting, the BoE also warns that rates could rise higher than it forecast three months ago. That\u2019s a clear warning to households and businesses to expect rising borrowing costs - even though the BoE resisted hiking at this month\u2019s meeting. Here\u2019s the key section from the report: Were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February Inflation Report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November Report. Breaking: The Bank of England has left UK interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. It\u2019s a unanimous decision too, with all nine policymakers voting to leave borrowing costs at their present level. More to follow! Tension is building in the City ahead of the Bank of England interest rate decision, due in 15 minutes. Although borrowing costs aren\u2019t expected to move, traders are wondering whether the Bank will use the minutes of this month\u2019s meeting to hint at future rate hikes. Mihir Kapadia \u2013 CEO and Founder of Sun Global Investments, says: \u201cAmidst a volatile week for the markets, traders are bracing themselves for the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision today. The BoE\u2019s decision comes at a time when concerns over rising inflation and the possibility of more central banks tightening monetary policy is a key driver of the markets. Although most analysts expect that rates will be unchanged , traders will be watching for clues about the probability of the timing and probability of a future interest rate rise. The FTSE 100 is still in the red (down 63 points right now), while the pound is unchanged against the US dollar at $1.388. European central bank policymaker Yves Mersch is putting the boot into bitcoin. In a speech in London, Mersch compares digital currencies to \u2018will-o\u2019-the-wisps\u2019 -- mysterious lights in the marsh that would lead unsuspecting travellers to their doom. He says: With the draining of marshes to make way for agricultural land, will-o\u2019-the-wisps are rarely sighted nowadays. But there remain plenty of distant flashing lights to distract travellers with promises of riches. As with the previous incarnation, these flashing lights often turn out to be just like bubbles of marsh gas \u2013 insubstantial and foul-smelling, but also flammable and sometimes able to burn things around them. The most recent beguiling wisps are named variously \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d \u2013 to denote the use of cryptographic methods and technology \u2013 or \u201cvirtual currencies\u201d (VCs) \u2013 to denote their lack of legal recognition. He then hits out at Bitcoin\u2019s inferiority to current payment systems. Bitcoin transactions generally require confirmation from six miners. With each block taking around ten minutes to mine, you would expect transactions to take an hour to process. But with recent network congestion, the average time for one confirmation can easily exceed several hours. At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with Bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed. Mersch says regulators need to \u2018urgently\u2019 look at how virtual currencies are being used, but also concedes that the underlying technologies may yet have a bright future. The speech is online here. Newsflash: Another 101 Carillion workers have just lost their jobs, following the company\u2019s collapse last month. The Official Receiver announced the latest redundancies this morning, alongside the better news that 1,221 jobs have been \u2018safeguarded\u2019. A spokesperson says: We have continued to review Carillion\u2019s contracts, as well as core divisions of the business, and I can confirm that we have safeguarded a further 1,221 jobs. These roles are connected to the delivery of both public and private contracts and cover services for a city council, as well as a range of facilities management services. This means so far, we have been able to save more than 2,000 jobs. \u201cRegrettably, we are also announcing that 101 roles have been made redundant. These are a mix of back-office functions and engineering support roles that new suppliers no longer require. Greece\u2019s public debt management agency (PDMA) has decided to press ahead today with the sale of a new seven-year bond. The auction, Greece\u2019s boldest foray yet onto international markets, had been put on ice by this week\u2019s market turbulence, but is now back on! Helena Smith explains: The government hopes to bring in at least \u20ac3bn from the markets \u2013 a significant addition to the \u20ac6.5bn cash buffer it has already built up to cover debt repayments when its third EU-IMF sponsored bailout programme ends. The seven-year euro benchmark had been postponed on account of market volatility with the sell off Monday. Now that markets have calmed down, the PDMA had decided to go ahead with the issue. Insiders say they expect the bond, which matures on February 15, 2015, to yield around 3.75%. The EU economic and financial affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici has begun a visit to Greece voicing optimism that the debt stricken country is well on the way to exiting its third international bailout programme. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Holding talks with Greece\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavalopoulos, the Frenchman not only expressed optimism that Athens was on the right track but went further still -- pinpointing a date by which the Euro zone\u2019s problem child will have exited its last economic adjustment programme. Once a fourth compliance reform review was over, \u201cGreece could conclude its exit from the program by June 21,\u201d he said. Moscovici, who will be holding closed-door talks with Athens\u2019 finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos this afternoon, has long seen himself as a champion of Greece. Before arriving in Athens, he told the country\u2019s state run news agency that his priority was to see Greece become a \u201cnormal euro area member state.\u201d \u201cNow is the time for a final effort to complete the programme successfully and move to a more peaceful and bright future, \u201c he said, adding that discussions has already begun on restructuring Greece\u2019s staggering \u20ac320bn debt load. \u201cTechnical work has already begun on a debt relief mechanism linked to economic growth, an idea first proposed last year and supported by the Eurogroup [of finance ministers] in June 2017\u201d. Brexit fears are also looming over the City today. Nicky Morgan MP has heavily criticised the government for failing to publish its \u201cposition paper on financial services\u201d, leaving banks in the dark about the future. That comes hot on the heels of the news that a hard Brexit could cost Britain \u00a380bn, with the north-east and the West Midlands hit particularly hard. Today\u2019s sell-off leaves the FTSE 100 hovering around 7220 points. Earlier this week it hit a 13-month trough, below 7,100, before Wednesday\u2019s rally clawed back some ground. Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief Analyst at ActivTrades, says: The rebounds of yesterday certified, as we suggested, that so far it is too early to call an inversion and the right word to call this movement is still \u201ccorrection\u201d after an important bullish rally. The scenario could change if FTSE 100 goes below 7,000 points and DAX below 11,950. Mining companies are pushing the FTSE 100 deeper into the red. After two hours trading, the blue chip index is down 60 points, or 0.8%. BHP Billiton, Antofagasta and Glencore are all among the top fallers. It would be worse apart from food company Compass, which posted decent results this morning, and pharma firm GlaxosmithKline which beat expectations yesterday. David Madden of CMC Markets says City traders have been booking profits after yesterday\u2019s rally: The weak finish in the US last night left traders feeling uneasy on this side of the Atlantic, and the optimistic sentiment that dominated yesterday has subsided. Traders are often nervous about holding a firm long position in the wake of a severe sell-off, and today\u2019s move is proof we are not out of the woods yet. At midday in the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s (BoE) update will be closely watched as it may add volatility to the pound. Equities (shares) have born the brunt of this week\u2019s volatility - with heavy losses in New York on Monday, then Europe and Asia on Tuesday. Larry Hatheway, group head of investment solutions at asset manager GAM, says there has been a rush to the exits, as traders who\u2019d bet on low volatility were suddenly badly hit. So, with interest rates likely to rise in the months ahead, Hatheway predicts that shares will continue be buffeted around: The most outstanding feature of the adverse market movements has been the discrepancy between shifts in equity prices and those of other assets. Long equity and short equity implied volatility were among the most crowded trades, meaning that risk management manoeuvres in response to the initial market action accelerated the sell-off. Nevertheless, while technical factors may have contributed to the extent of the adjustment, the source of it appears to have been driven by fundamentals as market participants come to terms with the beginning of the exit from the so-called \u201cnew normal\u201d. With the prospect of rising inflation both crimping corporate profits and making forthcoming monetary policy less predictable, we believe that expectations for equity returns need to be revised lower while implied volatility will rise from previously depressed levels. The team at ING have made a handy crib sheet showing what the Bank of England could do, and how the markets might react: UK department store group Debenhams has become the latest retailer to slash jobs. Debenhams is cutting 320 in-store management roles, as part of a push to \u201creduce cost and complexity\u201d This comes a month after the company hit shareholders with a profits warning, following a disappointing Christmas. Several analysts are predicting that one or two Bank of England policymakers will vote to raise UK interest rates today. Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty are the most likely hawks, out of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says the vote could move the markets today: \u201cThe rise to 0.75% is expected to come at some point in the next few months, with many thinking that the UK economy is performing well enough to shoulder a rate hike in May. \u201cWhat will be scrutinised most by traders is the composition of Thursday\u2019s vote. Any more than two thumbs up for a rate rise could see the pound make significant gains, while ears will then tune into any remarks Mark Carney follows up with. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale thinks the Bank might pave the way to a rate hike in three months. The UK MPC meets today with the market universally expecting no change in policy, but also expecting an element of hawkishness in preparation for a hike this spring. The market prices a 50% chance of a May hike and anything which pushes those expectations back leaves GBP (the British pound) a little vulnerable. Most analysts are sticking to the idea that the markets are going through a healthy correction, not a panicky crash. So investors have to decide whether to plunge in and buy some shares, or keep safely on the sidelines until things calm down. It\u2019s a great time to be a daredevil speculator, but long-term investors may not be enjoying the ride. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, predicts markets could shed another 10%: Many contrarians would like to follow Baron Rothschild\u2019s advice: \u201cBuy when there\u2019s blood in the streets\u201d. As of now, I do not see any blood, but a healthy correction which has been overdue for a long time. From a valuation perspective, the forward price to earnings ratio on the S&amp;P 500 has dropped from 20 at the beginning of the year to below 18, suggesting that prices are still expensive when compared to historic averages. Deciding to buy, sell, or hold is a tough one in such circumstances, but if investors believe the global economy and corporates will continue firing on all cylinders, the downside risk is likely to be limited from current levels. However, another 5-10% correction should not be ruled out. Fixed income markets have started looking attractive and if the surge in bold yields resumes, there will be more incentives to pull out from stocks to bonds. That\u2019s why bond markets, particularly in the U.S. will play a major role in how much further the correction may continue. Down we go again.... Trading is underway in London, where the FTSE 100 has dropped 28 points to 7251. The other European markets are also down, with the Stoxx 600 benchmark losing around 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s another nervous day on Europe\u2019s trading floors. Shares are expected to fall back, unravelling Wednesday\u2019s recovery, as the wild swings that have dominated this week continue. Wall Street suffered a late wobble last night, with the Dow Jones surrendering all its gains to close slightly lower (down 19 points). That\u2019s going to feed through to the City, where the FTSE 100 is being called down around 0.6%. Worries over rising inflation and bond yields continue to drive the markets, with traders wondering how fast central banks will tighten monetary policy. That means the Bank of England will be centre stage today. The BoE will set interest rates at noon today, and also release its latest quarterly inflation report -- packed with new economic forecasts. One or two policymakers may vote for a rate hike -- but the majority will almost certainly vote to leave rates at 0.5%. The big question is whether the BoE is inching closer to raising borrowing costs in May. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says governor Mark Carney will face plenty of questions about the UK economic outlook: Today\u2019s interest rate decision isn\u2019t expected to offer too many surprises on the rates front, the main steer for the next move in the pound will come from Governor Carney\u2019s assessment of the UK economy, which he has already stated is suffering from under investment as a result of the uncertainty being generated by the Brexit talks. Markets will also be looking for any further steers on the outlook for wages growth, as well as productivity which has also started to show signs of improving. It will be in the area of wages that markets could well focus most of their attention, particularly in light of last week\u2019s strong US wages numbers, which has made bond markets globally particularly susceptible to how policy makers view the outlook for them. Several other central bankers are speaking today, which should keep the markets on their toes. The agenda 10.30am GMT: ECB executive board member Yves Mersch speech on Digital Currency.

Whether it is a bad investment is the big question. Bitcoin can only be used as a medium of exchange and in practice has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses. The lack of any central authority makes bitcoin remarkably resilient to censorship, corruption \u2013&nbsp;or regulation. That means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Nouriel Roubini </h2> \n<p>The American economist credited with predicting the 2008 financial crash has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/bitcoin-biggest-bubble-in-history-says-economist-who-predicted-2008-crash\">called bitcoin \u201cthe mother of all bubbles\u201d</a> and \u201cmuch worse\u201d than tulip mania.

      "bodyText": "Bitcoin\u2019s gyrations have attracted a lot of attention over the past year. Here are some of the most memorable comments from senior figures in world finance. Yves Mersch Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank\u2019s executive board, called for a global clampdown on virtual currencies because of their threat to financial stability on 8 February. Bitcoin transactions can easily take several hours to process, he noted in a speech in London. At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed.\u201d Agust\u00edn Carstens The new head of the Bank for International Settlements has described bitcoin as \u201ca bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster\u201d. \u201cIf authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability,\u201d he said in a speech on 6 February. Nouriel Roubini The American economist credited with predicting the 2008 financial crash has called bitcoin \u201cthe mother of all bubbles\u201d and \u201cmuch worse\u201d than tulip mania. He told Bloomberg TV on 2 February: \u201cIt\u2019s on the way down to zero. The fundamental value of bitcoin is zero.\u201d He said the other 1,300-plus cryptocurrencies were \u201ceven worse\u201d and slammed the underlying blockchain technology. He added that blockchain has been around for 10 years and its only application is bitcoin or cryptocurrencies and they \u201care a scam\u201d. Roubini tweeted this week: \u201cCryptocrazies are also criminal Cyber-Terrorists.\u201d He also claimed that his consulting firm, Roubini Global Economics, was targeted in a 2015 denial-of-service attack because he criticised bitcoin. Jamie Dimon JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said in mid-September that Bitcoin was a fraud that would ultimately blow up. He said the digital currency was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea. The boss of America\u2019s biggest bank said he would fire \u201cin a second\u201d anyone at the investment bank found to be trading in bitcoin. He later softened his stance, and revealed on 9 January that his daughter had bought two bitcoins. Robert Shiller The Nobel prizewinning economist predicted on 26 January that bitcoin would not be a \u201cpermanent feature\u201d of the financial world. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Shiller hailed bitcoin as a \u201creally clever idea\u201d. I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it\u2019s not a permanent feature of our lives.\u201d Shiller has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. \u201cWe are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.\u201d Warren Buffett The billionaire investor said on 11 January he would never invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and predicted the wildly popular assets were in for a fall. \u201cI can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,\u201d Buffett told CNBC in an interview. Joseph Stiglitz The Nobel-prize-winning economist has argued that the currency should be outlawed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t serve any socially useful function.\u201d Sir Howard Davies The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has painted an apocalyptic picture for bitcoin. He told Bloomberg TV on 8 December, after bitcoin hit $15,000 for the first time: Put up the sign from Dante\u2019s Inferno \u2013 \u2018Abandon hope all ye who enter here\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably what\u2019s needed.\u201d Janet Yellen On 15 December, the former US Federal Reserve chair described bitcoin as a \u201chighly speculative asset\u201d and \u201cnot a stable source of value\u201d, but noted it remained a very small part of the global payment system.

Theresa May Theresa May said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that she was concerned criminals were exploiting digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. \u201cIn areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,\u201d May told Bloomberg. Steven Mnuchin The US treasury secretary also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. \u201cMy number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they\u2019re not used for illicit activities,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC.",

      "bodyText": "South Australia plans to use Friday\u2019s meeting of the prime minister and premiers to raise concerns about GST distributions before the state goes to the polls on 17 March. While a hospitals funding row is expected to dominate Friday\u2019s talks, the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, will also raise objections to a potential loss in GST revenue as part of radical changes floated last year by the Productivity Commission \u2013 recommendations that have also troubled other states. \u201cWe already know the Liberals have cut $210m from South Australian schools and the Liberals are planning to cut South Australia\u2019s GST revenue by $557m,\u201d Weatherill said before the Council of Australian Governments meeting. \u201cAt Coag, I will be standing up for South Australia and fighting the Liberals\u2019 savage cuts to South Australian schools, hospitals and GST revenue.\u201d A draft report handed down by the Productivity Commission four months ago put the cat among the pigeons on the GST carve-up, proposing a radical overhaul of distributions that would see Australia\u2019s eastern states losing billions of dollars in GST revenue and Western Australia receiving a multibillion-dollar windfall. Premiers facing elections in the first part of this year want the final report from the Productivity Commission, currently due for release after the May budget, to be made public sooner so the revenue implications can be made transparent. The rising public agitation from premiers such as Weatherill has prompted senior players in Canberra to argue this week that they will speak up for the interests of their home state. The education minister, Simon Birmingham, said future recommendations from the Productivity Commission would be discussed, and it was important to have a proper process, \u201cbut I can assure you that South Australian federal Liberal MPs will look out for South Australia\u2019s interests\u201d. The premiers dined with the prime minister at The Lodge on Thursday evening before Friday\u2019s meeting in Canberra. Federal officials say the Turnbull government\u2019s new hospitals funding offer is worth $128bn over five years but the Labor premiers have signalled in advance that proposal, put at officials level a week ago, is not good enough. The New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said on Thursday the current health budget in NSW comprised almost one-third of the budget. \u201cAny new agreement would have to give capacity to deal with the anticipated growth in health funding through population pressures and increasing complexity of treatments,\u201d Hazzard said. He said he was hopeful consensus on hospitals funding would be reached \u201cin due course\u201d. The proposed funding plan will set out federal hospital contributions for the five years from 2020. The agreement, which mirrors a previous deal struck in 2016, will have the commonwealth paying 45% of hospital funding and cap federal funding growth at 6.5% per year. Canberra has also offered the states a proportion of a new $100m health \u201cinnovation\u201d fund if they agree to sign on to the proposal at Friday\u2019s meeting. An extract of the draft heads of agreement circulating before Friday\u2019s meeting obtained by Guardian Australia says 50% of the proposed $100m fund \u201cwill be made available for the use of states that sign up to this agreement on 9 February 2018, to be divided amongst signatory states\u201d. Given Tasmania is currently in a caretaker period, the draft heads of agreement makes it clear the offer remains current if the incoming administration signs up within two weeks of the swearing in of the next Tasmanian government. It says all states, inclusive of any government signing on to the deal on Friday, will have access to the remaining 50% of the innovation fund from 1 July 2020 \u201conce all states have signed this agreement\u201d. Friday\u2019s talks will also cover Indigenous issues, schools funding, bullying, the response to the royal commission into child sexual abuse and the development of northern Australia, and there will be an update on national security.",

It has been stopped since 8.54pm on 10 February 1964, the minute he was submerged in waters of the Pacific along with fellow crew members on HMAS Voyager, fearing \u2013 expecting \u2013 that he wouldn\u2019t get out alive. He was probably the last to escape. Hellier, a senior radio operator, had just finished his shift and was sitting at a table in the Voyager\u2019s cafeteria when the destroyer was struck and cut in two by the much larger aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne. He heard a loud bang, and the force of the impact catapulted him towards the steel base of a gun, badly cutting his head. The front section of the ship rolled over onto the side and then righted itself, but then water suddenly poured into the room. As the water level rose fast, it became clear the ship was sinking. \u201cThe coxswain turned round and said \u2018I\u2019m sorry lads, we\u2019re done for\u2019 and started singing Abide With Me,\u201d says Hellier. But Hellier had discovered a small hatch in a wall behind some lockers in the officers\u2019 mess a few months earlier, when the ship had been in Williamstown dockyard during a refit. His head wound bleeding profusely, he made his way towards the hatch. \u201cThe water was up to our waists when I decided to take off. \u201cI knew where there was a very small hatch. I headed for that because I thought I was small enough to fit through. \u201cIt was bedlam. There were bodies everywhere and people screaming. They had drowned on impact because the water was rushing in and they got knocked over.\u201d The Voyager submerged and his watch stopped. \u201cPeople were in front of me. I helped push a couple in front of me through the hatch. I just said, \u2018Go! Go! Go!\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned around and there was no one else coming out. One body floated past me. I was last out.\u201d Hellier surfaced and swam. \u201cI got out and got myself free and then turned around. The bow was there, and it went down, and came up again. Then it went down forever. Once she bobbed the second time no one got out. \u201cIt was a moonlight night. The water was warm.\u201d Eighty-two of the Voyager\u2019s 314 crew were killed on impact or drowned, trapped in the bow section which sank only 10 minutes after the collision. The stern section of the ship remained upright and floated for about two hours, allowing other crewmen on board to jump into the ocean, swim to the HMAS Melbourne and climb scramble nets onto the aircraft carrier.

The banks said on Thursday that they would not enforce the confidentiality clauses, but it still leaves the question of how many will be willing to come forward.</p> <p>As a macroeconomic researcher who has spent the last few years investigating the dark side of Australia\u2019s $1.7tn mortgage market, I can tell you it\u2019s not a pretty sight. While illegal misconduct by mortgage lenders appears systemic, what is even more concerning is that our financial regulators, such as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) and Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) who are supposed to protect society from financial misconduct, appear to be caught up in what is described as \u201cregulatory capture\u201d.</p> <p>This is the situation that occurs when a government\u2019s regulatory agency ends up advancing the political or commercial concerns of the very people, companies or entities it is supposed to be regulating.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.lfeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/APH-Consumer-Protection-Submission.pdf\">my research</a> has unearthed several hundred instances whereby a mortgage borrower had discovered once they were in default that their financial circumstances had been modified by their lenders in order for computerised loan approval algorithms to approve the loan in the first place. These are loans that should never have been granted. More often than not unfortunately, these types of allegations arise en masse only when we see a negative change to the economic conditions of a particular town or region\u2019s housing market.</p> <p>This should have set alarm bells ringing with Asic (on a case-by-case basis) and Apra (at a systemic scale). However, when these alleged victims contacted Asic or Apra to make these types of serious allegations, <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/issuing-new-loans-against-unrealised-capital-gains-has-created-an-australian-house-of-cards/news-story/853e540ce0a8ed95d5881a730b6ed2c9\">the regulators refused to investigate</a> the matter, leaving the borrower at the mercy of the financial ombudsmen who (based on my experience in helping out the odd alleged victim for research purposes) pressures borrowers into signing unfavourable and unreasonable settlements with their lenders despite clear acts of misconduct by the lender. That is regulatory capture.</p> <p>Fortunately, a few victims were helped by financial consumer activists, or the media who aided them into receiving favourable settlements with their lenders to reflect the damage caused. Often though they had to sign a document forbidding public disclosure of the settled matter. Even those alleged victims who settled under very unfavourable terms relative to the alleged financial crime committed against them had also been forced to sign agreements inclusive of similar confidentiality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/feb/07/productivity-commission-says-financial-system-allows-banks-to-exploit-customers\">Banks are exploiting loyal customers, warns Productivity Commission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as the royal commission offers these borrowers no legal protection should they speak up, it is highly unlikely that any of them will do so. </p> <p>If alleged victims of financial misconduct are not able to speak up, and our financial regulators had previously refused these individuals protection and justice under the laws they regulate, why are we even having a royal commission into the financial services sector in the first place? In my opinion, and based on the circumstances that lay in front of us, Apra and Asic should hold just as much accountability (if not more when the financial system fails its consumers) as the banks and lenders and insurance companies they regulate that acted with misconduct in the first place.</p> <p>The unfortunate reality of regulatory capture, particularly when it comes to financial services and mortgages, is that current and future consumers of financial products are completely unaware whether a lender has a good or not-so-good track record of acting within the rules. </p> <p>Ultimately, Asic and Apra would prefer society to believe that it is the mortgage broker industry that has created all these problems. However, it\u2019s a little hard to allege mortgage broker misconduct when an alleged victim didn\u2019t even use the broker channel to acquire financing. But this mantra fits in nicely with the lenders Asic and Apra regulate. While there are more than likely a few bad-apple mortgage brokers out there, they are not the industry participants that approve or decline a mortgage or lend money; but likely the industry participants this royal commission will attempt to throw under a bus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It hasn\u2019t even started yet \u2013 you\u2019ll have to wait until Monday for that \u2013 but the royal commission into banks could turn out to be a dud. The commission says it will offer no legal protection to alleged victims of misconduct by the industry who have already signed confidentiality agreements that prevent them speaking publicly about their experiences. Not a good start, because without such testimony it\u2019s hard to see where the commission\u2019s impact will come from. The banks said on Thursday that they would not enforce the confidentiality clauses, but it still leaves the question of how many will be willing to come forward. As a macroeconomic researcher who has spent the last few years investigating the dark side of Australia\u2019s $1.7tn mortgage market, I can tell you it\u2019s not a pretty sight. While illegal misconduct by mortgage lenders appears systemic, what is even more concerning is that our financial regulators, such as the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) and Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic) who are supposed to protect society from financial misconduct, appear to be caught up in what is described as \u201cregulatory capture\u201d. This is the situation that occurs when a government\u2019s regulatory agency ends up advancing the political or commercial concerns of the very people, companies or entities it is supposed to be regulating. For example, my research has unearthed several hundred instances whereby a mortgage borrower had discovered once they were in default that their financial circumstances had been modified by their lenders in order for computerised loan approval algorithms to approve the loan in the first place. These are loans that should never have been granted. More often than not unfortunately, these types of allegations arise en masse only when we see a negative change to the economic conditions of a particular town or region\u2019s housing market. This should have set alarm bells ringing with Asic (on a case-by-case basis) and Apra (at a systemic scale). However, when these alleged victims contacted Asic or Apra to make these types of serious allegations, the regulators refused to investigate the matter, leaving the borrower at the mercy of the financial ombudsmen who (based on my experience in helping out the odd alleged victim for research purposes) pressures borrowers into signing unfavourable and unreasonable settlements with their lenders despite clear acts of misconduct by the lender. That is regulatory capture. Fortunately, a few victims were helped by financial consumer activists, or the media who aided them into receiving favourable settlements with their lenders to reflect the damage caused. Often though they had to sign a document forbidding public disclosure of the settled matter. Even those alleged victims who settled under very unfavourable terms relative to the alleged financial crime committed against them had also been forced to sign agreements inclusive of similar confidentiality. But as the royal commission offers these borrowers no legal protection should they speak up, it is highly unlikely that any of them will do so. If alleged victims of financial misconduct are not able to speak up, and our financial regulators had previously refused these individuals protection and justice under the laws they regulate, why are we even having a royal commission into the financial services sector in the first place? In my opinion, and based on the circumstances that lay in front of us, Apra and Asic should hold just as much accountability (if not more when the financial system fails its consumers) as the banks and lenders and insurance companies they regulate that acted with misconduct in the first place. The unfortunate reality of regulatory capture, particularly when it comes to financial services and mortgages, is that current and future consumers of financial products are completely unaware whether a lender has a good or not-so-good track record of acting within the rules. Ultimately, Asic and Apra would prefer society to believe that it is the mortgage broker industry that has created all these problems. However, it\u2019s a little hard to allege mortgage broker misconduct when an alleged victim didn\u2019t even use the broker channel to acquire financing. But this mantra fits in nicely with the lenders Asic and Apra regulate. While there are more than likely a few bad-apple mortgage brokers out there, they are not the industry participants that approve or decline a mortgage or lend money; but likely the industry participants this royal commission will attempt to throw under a bus.",

      "bodyText": "A Rohingyan refugee living in Australia is pleading with the Australian government to grant him a travel document allowing him to speak at the European parliament about the persecution of his people. Habiburahman \u2013 who goes by only one name \u2013 arrived in Australia from Myanmar, which was then known as Burma, by boat in 2009. But he has spent 18 years as a stateless refugee and cannot currently leave Australia. He is pleading for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Rohingya people he says are silenced by the Myanmar military government. His book, D\u2019Abord, ils ont efface notre nom \u2013 First they erased our name \u2013 cowritten with French author Sophie Ansel, charts his own life and the persecution of his people. It is set to be launched in Europe this month. Belgian MEP Marie Arena, has invited him to address the European parliament about the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya people, and he is also scheduled to meet with representatives from Amnesty International. Letters of support have been sent to the French president, Emmanuel Macron. \u201cThis is my chance to speak for my people, who continue to suffer, but who are voiceless,\u201d Habiburahman told the Guardian. The Rohingya ethnic minority has faced generations of persecution from the military junta which rules Myanmar. The Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, have previously been limited to having two children, and face arbitrary detention and internment in labour camps. They are excluded from education, certain professions and moving outside defined areas. The Myanmar government refuses to uses the term Rohingya: it regards the Rohingya as Bangladeshis living illegitimately in Myanmar. In August last year, the military began a new wave of violence against the Rohingya in the western Rakhine state, burning villages and killing civilians in a pogrom described by the UN as \u201ctextbook ethnic cleansing\u201d. More than 680,000 Rohingya have fled over Myanmar\u2019s border into Bangladesh. And last week, further evidence has emerged over alleged mass graves of civilians in Rohingya villages. \u201cWe are the unspeakable,\u201d Habiburahman said. \u201cIn Burma, we are not allowed to say we are Rohingya, and you cannot say what is happening to us. You cannot report what is happening to police. It is like our mouth has been shut up, our eyes have been closed up. We are like slaves.\u201d Habiburahman has been displaced and stateless since 2000, when he fled his homeland, aged 19, after facing harassment, arrest and forced labour. He went first to Thailand and then Malaysia, where he spent nine years. In both countries he was repeatedly arrested and deported because he held no valid citizenship. Upon arriving in Australia \u2013 the only country he has ever set foot in that observes the protections of the refugee convention \u2013 he was recognised within months as a refugee but still spent 32 months in immigration detention centres across the country. Protesting the delays, he staged a rooftop protest and a hunger strike, over which he was convicted of damaging commonwealth property. This conviction meant that, instead of being granted a protection visa, he was deemed to have failed the character test, and placed on a removal pending visa, despite there being no country that recognises him as a citizen. Habiburahman has lived in Melbourne on the visa for five years. But the conditions of his visa mean he is unable to leave the country, or re-enter Australia if he does. He has since been asked to re-apply for a protection visa. \u201cEverything has been limited. I cannot travel, I cannot belong. It is very upsetting. It is the same thing back in Burma. \u201cI am stateless in Australia, for many years. My punishment is kept alive forever.\u201d Habiburahman has formally requested Australia\u2019s immigration officials \u2013 part of the new Department of Home Affairs \u2013 grant him travel documents to go to Europe to launch his book and speak with lawmakers. His co-author Sophie Ansel told the Guardian his testimony was vital. \u201cIt is not only necessary for him to be there, it is an emergency. It is a duty for whoever has the power to facilitate this trip to do it because there are not many chances for Rohingyas to raise their voice and because every day that passes without the international community acting is one more day where villages are burned, where families are forced to flee, where people are killed and raped.\u201d Habiburahman sees his visit as a service to his people, both those Rohingya still inside Myanmar, and the diaspora that has fled over the country\u2019s borders. \u201cThe world needs to hear the story of the Rohingya, I can speak for them, this is my role to play for my people.\u201d If Habiburahman leaves Australia it appears he will not be allowed back in. A spokesman for home affairs said the department did not comment on individual visa cases, but told the Guardian: \u201cthe removal pending bridging visa enables the release of people from immigration detention into the community in instances where their removal from Australia is not reasonably practicable at that time\u201d. \u201cThe visa does not provide any right of re-entry if the visa holder departs Australia.\u201d",

Eddie has said he is going to put us under pressure, but the same goes for us. Shaun Edwards (the defence coach) has been banging that drum. When the stakes are high there is no quarter asked and none given. That\u2019s what it will be on Saturday.\u201d",

It\u2019s been a long time since any widely-respected global figure acclaimed English footballers as masters of any of the sport\u2019s technical aspects, and though our players would surely prefer to receive plaudits for their intelligent movement, all-round sporting dedication or the haunting melodies of their heavily-sponsored supporters\u2019 brass band, they will very much take what they\u2019re given. Yes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has announced that \u201cEnglish players might even be the masters\u201d of something. As Wenger himself might say, <em>le jour de gloire est arriv\u00e9</em>! Hang out the bunting, fetch your William Blake anthologies and lavishly renovate the Houses of Parliament, we are champions of the world once more!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/08/arsene-wenger-arsenal-claims-english-players-are-now-the-masters-of-diving\">At diving</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/08/arsene-wenger-arsenal-claims-english-players-are-now-the-masters-of-diving\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger claims English players are now the 'masters' of diving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Arsenal due to play Tottenham and their all-English penalty-area tumble twins Harry Kane and Dele Alli on Saturday, the subject of simulation inevitably cropped up in Wenger\u2019s press conference on Thursday morning. \u201cI remember there were tremendous cases here when foreign players did it,\u201d he tooted, \u201cbut I must say the English players have learned very quickly and they might even be the masters now.\u201d <em>Might even be the masters. </em>That\u2019s right, world. We have watched, we have learned, we have copied and we have improved, and this June we\u2019re going to totally Diegosimeone our way to greatness.</p> <p>This will now be the English way. In Brazil four years ago Mr Roy\u2019s team bus was emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cThe dream of one team, the heartbeat of millions!!\u201d, which sounded like they\u2019d picked two halves of a sentence from a big bucket of inspirational half-sentences and just stuck them together, but was vaguely encouraging. In 2010 we had \u201cPlaying with Pride and Glory\u201d. In 2006 there was \u201cOne Nation, One Trophy, Eleven Lions\u201d. In Russia let it be, \u201cTry to push the boundaries to win your game without cheating!!\u201d though, for full and frank disclosure, The Fiver would add the words, \u201cand failing that, cheat!\u201d Now we know what we\u2019re good at, we need to base our game around it. Should any of Gareth Southgate\u2019s charges sense the vague possibility of penalty-area contact the advice must be: close your eyes, lie down and think of England.<br></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cI should never have gone to Las Palmas.

Not only were the Proclaimers prepared to walk 500 miles to be the man who falls down at your door, but they were also, as they quite clearly stated, prepared to walk \u2018500 more\u2019, giving a total acceptable distance of 1,000 miles.

It\u2019s been a long time since any widely-respected global figure acclaimed English footballers as masters of any of the sport\u2019s technical aspects, and though our players would surely prefer to receive plaudits for their intelligent movement, all-round sporting dedication or the haunting melodies of their heavily-sponsored supporters\u2019 brass band, they will very much take what they\u2019re given. Yes, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has announced that \u201cEnglish players might even be the masters\u201d of something. As Wenger himself might say, le jour de gloire est arriv\u00e9! Hang out the bunting, fetch your William Blake anthologies and lavishly renovate the Houses of Parliament, we are champions of the world once more! At diving. With Arsenal due to play Tottenham and their all-English penalty-area tumble twins Harry Kane and Dele Alli on Saturday, the subject of simulation inevitably cropped up in Wenger\u2019s press conference on Thursday morning. \u201cI remember there were tremendous cases here when foreign players did it,\u201d he tooted, \u201cbut I must say the English players have learned very quickly and they might even be the masters now.\u201d Might even be the masters. That\u2019s right, world. We have watched, we have learned, we have copied and we have improved, and this June we\u2019re going to totally Diegosimeone our way to greatness. This will now be the English way. In Brazil four years ago Mr Roy\u2019s team bus was emblazoned with the slogan: \u201cThe dream of one team, the heartbeat of millions!!\u201d, which sounded like they\u2019d picked two halves of a sentence from a big bucket of inspirational half-sentences and just stuck them together, but was vaguely encouraging. In 2010 we had \u201cPlaying with Pride and Glory\u201d. In 2006 there was \u201cOne Nation, One Trophy, Eleven Lions\u201d. In Russia let it be, \u201cTry to push the boundaries to win your game without cheating!!\u201d though, for full and frank disclosure, The Fiver would add the words, \u201cand failing that, cheat!\u201d Now we know what we\u2019re good at, we need to base our game around it. Should any of Gareth Southgate\u2019s charges sense the vague possibility of penalty-area contact the advice must be: close your eyes, lie down and think of England. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI should never have gone to Las Palmas. When I said yes I didn\u2019t even know that the team was on an island\u201d \u2013 Oussama Tannane, whose loan from St \u00c9tienne was abruptly cut short, will hopefully do more due diligence in future.

SUPPORT THE GUARDIAN Producing the Guardian\u2019s thoughtful, in-depth journalism \u2013 the stuff not normally found in this email, obviously \u2013 is expensive, but supporting us isn\u2019t. If you value our journalism, please support us by making a one-off or recurring contribution. FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe c0ckles of my heart were indeed warmed by the tale of the boy who travelled from Trinidad to meet his hero, and full marks to Thibaut Courtois for treating his young fan so considerately. The story brought to mind the time David Seaman gave his gloves to Mickey Thomas to pass on to his kid after Wrexham dumped Arsenal out of the FA Cup. And I wondered if other Fiver readers had heartwarming tales to tell of meeting their goalkeeping hero? Mine is Gordon Banks and I\u2019ve never met him\u201d \u2013 Kevin McKee. \u201cI\u2019d like to point out the 10-year-old Chelsea fan who travelled more than 4,417 miles to meet Thibaut Courtois is not \u2018almost nine-times more fervent than the Proclaimers\u2019, as claimed in yesterday\u2019s Fiver but almost four and a half times. Not only were the Proclaimers prepared to walk 500 miles to be the man who falls down at your door, but they were also, as they quite clearly stated, prepared to walk \u2018500 more\u2019, giving a total acceptable distance of 1,000 miles. Lazy journalism, I expect better from The Guardian and so forth\u201d \u2013 Paul Croft (and 1,056 others). \u201cIn your rallying cry for Newport in yesterday\u2019s Fiver you forgot the Nato summit of 2014. There was no mention of Newport in the logo but everyone will have been able to guess where it was being held as the town was represented by an image of the Newport Transporter Bridge \u2013 an icon of the skyline, and one of only six operational transporter bridges left worldwide\u201d \u2013 John Stainton. \u201cNever mind \u2018outlandish dreams\u2019 like Newport having two Pizza Huts, The Fiver discovered this through actual (Google) research. Are we in some sort of Twilight Zone?\u201d \u2013 Ed Taylor. \u201cTo Tom Murray-Rust, who incorrectly identified the Rhubarb Triangle as between the typically showy Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letter), I say shame on you. As a proud Pomfretian, I can confirm the true Rhubarb Triangle sits between the much less glamorous Wakefield, Morley and Rothwell, within which Pontefract sits. It\u2019s why we can grow such fantastic liquorice too, and is what ultimately gave birth to the esteemed Pontefract cake\u201d \u2013 Kris Holland. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

As the acting matron for St George\u2019s primary care and substance misuse service at HMP Wandsworth, she never knows what to expect on any given day.</p> <p>Wilson says: \u201cThe prisoners have all the same problems that people have when they are not in prison.\u201d In addition to providing care to patients with minor ailments, nurses in offender healthcare are frequently required to treat prisoners who have self harmed, been involved in physical altercations or are suffering from the effects of substance abuse.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be called to the job and not actually know what we\u2019re going to arrive to,\u201d adds Wilson.</p> <p>Consequently, she says prison nurses have to be practical and adaptable. \u201cWe also have to be quite fit. If we get called to an emergency, we have to run from wherever we are and it\u2019s quite a big prison with a lot of steps to run up and down.\u201d <br></p> <p>Aoife Cronin, a junior sister and general nurse, agrees. \u201cWe have to go on to the wings and find the guys to bring them down for clinics. That can also be challenging if there has been a problem and it\u2019s on lockdown. You also have to be able to build up a rapport with the officers and we work very closely with them.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve done nothing but enhance my skills since I started</p> <footer> <cite>Aoife Cronin, junior sister and general nurse</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a far cry from her days working as a surgical nurse in a hospital, but she wanted a new challenge and moved to the service in October last year. </p> <p>The transition to offender healthcare was made easier thanks to a supportive team. Cronin, who has had extensive training, and would eventually like to be an advanced nurse practitioner, says: \u201cMy nursing friends thought I would be bored when I moved here or would lose my skills, but I\u2019ve done nothing but enhance my skills since I started. You do a bit of everything and it can feel like trauma nursing sometimes. There is a lot of opportunity to develop ... they [St George\u2019s offender healthcare service] are really open to helping you work towards your goals.\u201d</p> <p>Her shift starts with a handover with the night team at 7.30am. An important part of the job is assessing prisoners when they first come in, going through any medication they\u2019re taking and discussing any existing health issues or wounds. </p> <p>On an offender\u2019s second day in the prison, it\u2019s a little more personal, with various tests for sexually transmitted infections, HIV and hepatitis. Cronin says: \u201cWe can then catch them [the infections] early and treat them as much as we can. A lot of the patients are being treated for these things for the very first time. We also make sure they are safe if they are detoxing.\u201d</p> <p>As well as general clinics for day-to-day issues, Cronin runs a wound clinic three times a week. \u201cA lot of [the patients in prison] are drug addicts and can develop big ulcers from injecting so much. They take a long time to heal but luckily with all the hard work that everyone has been putting in, we have nearly healed most of them,\u201d says Cronin.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wish more people would be able to get the experience of what it\u2019s like</p> <footer> <cite>Briony Wilson, acting matron, St George\u2019s offender healthcare</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is a lot you can do in a prison to help your patients and to change their lives when they leave. It\u2019s a lot different to being on a ward.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cWhen you see someone three times a week for half an hour at a time, they start to trust you and might tell you about other issues they have.\u201d</p> <p>This opportunity to help change people\u2019s lives means an unusual highlight of the job is when patients are released from prison and don\u2019t come back. Wilson explains: \u201cWe tend to get men who come in and out of prison. When they come in again, there\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Oh no, what are you doing back here?\u2019 There was one guy who promised me that I would not see him again. I haven\u2019t seen him for a while, so that feels like a success.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the prisoners are vulnerable. \u201cSo many stories do affect you because there are people in prisons who have had very difficult and very challenging lives,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a heart of steel for that not to touch you \u2013 and to [not] want to see them overcome it and stay out of prison when released.\u201d</p> <p>Having clear boundaries with patients is absolutely crucial, however. For example, comforting patients by putting an arm around them is not allowed.

      "bodyText": "Briony Wilson compares her job to a cross between a practice nurse at a busy GP surgery and a paramedic dealing with emergencies. As the acting matron for St George\u2019s primary care and substance misuse service at HMP Wandsworth, she never knows what to expect on any given day. Wilson says: \u201cThe prisoners have all the same problems that people have when they are not in prison.\u201d In addition to providing care to patients with minor ailments, nurses in offender healthcare are frequently required to treat prisoners who have self harmed, been involved in physical altercations or are suffering from the effects of substance abuse. \u201cWe\u2019ll be called to the job and not actually know what we\u2019re going to arrive to,\u201d adds Wilson. Consequently, she says prison nurses have to be practical and adaptable. \u201cWe also have to be quite fit. If we get called to an emergency, we have to run from wherever we are and it\u2019s quite a big prison with a lot of steps to run up and down.\u201d Aoife Cronin, a junior sister and general nurse, agrees. \u201cWe have to go on to the wings and find the guys to bring them down for clinics. That can also be challenging if there has been a problem and it\u2019s on lockdown. You also have to be able to build up a rapport with the officers and we work very closely with them.\u201d It\u2019s a far cry from her days working as a surgical nurse in a hospital, but she wanted a new challenge and moved to the service in October last year. The transition to offender healthcare was made easier thanks to a supportive team. Cronin, who has had extensive training, and would eventually like to be an advanced nurse practitioner, says: \u201cMy nursing friends thought I would be bored when I moved here or would lose my skills, but I\u2019ve done nothing but enhance my skills since I started. You do a bit of everything and it can feel like trauma nursing sometimes. There is a lot of opportunity to develop ... they [St George\u2019s offender healthcare service] are really open to helping you work towards your goals.\u201d Her shift starts with a handover with the night team at 7.30am. An important part of the job is assessing prisoners when they first come in, going through any medication they\u2019re taking and discussing any existing health issues or wounds. On an offender\u2019s second day in the prison, it\u2019s a little more personal, with various tests for sexually transmitted infections, HIV and hepatitis. Cronin says: \u201cWe can then catch them [the infections] early and treat them as much as we can. A lot of the patients are being treated for these things for the very first time. We also make sure they are safe if they are detoxing.\u201d As well as general clinics for day-to-day issues, Cronin runs a wound clinic three times a week. \u201cA lot of [the patients in prison] are drug addicts and can develop big ulcers from injecting so much. They take a long time to heal but luckily with all the hard work that everyone has been putting in, we have nearly healed most of them,\u201d says Cronin. \u201cThere is a lot you can do in a prison to help your patients and to change their lives when they leave. It\u2019s a lot different to being on a ward.\u201d She adds: \u201cWhen you see someone three times a week for half an hour at a time, they start to trust you and might tell you about other issues they have.\u201d This opportunity to help change people\u2019s lives means an unusual highlight of the job is when patients are released from prison and don\u2019t come back. Wilson explains: \u201cWe tend to get men who come in and out of prison. When they come in again, there\u2019s that feeling of \u2018Oh no, what are you doing back here?\u2019 There was one guy who promised me that I would not see him again. I haven\u2019t seen him for a while, so that feels like a success.\u201d Many of the prisoners are vulnerable. \u201cSo many stories do affect you because there are people in prisons who have had very difficult and very challenging lives,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a heart of steel for that not to touch you \u2013 and to [not] want to see them overcome it and stay out of prison when released.\u201d Having clear boundaries with patients is absolutely crucial, however. For example, comforting patients by putting an arm around them is not allowed. Wilson says: \u201cYou have to convey that care and compassion that is part of every nurse\u2019s job through verbal communication.\u201d Both Wilson and Cronin think many nurses, especially those looking for a new challenge, would enjoy the job.

Folha said its own research showed that shares, comments and likes for the 10 biggest Brazilian newspapers via Facebook fell 32% in the 12 months from January 2017. In an article on Thursday, Folha said that from October to January it analysed interactions via Facebook with 21 sites that publish fake news and 51 \u201cprofessional journalism\u201d sites. Fake news interactions on Facebook tripled, while interactions with professional journalist sites fell 17%. Fake news interactions fell slightly in January, following Facebook\u2019s algorithm change, Folha said. The paper said it will keep its Facebook page, which has 6 million followers, but no longer update it. Concern over fake news is rising in Brazil ahead of October\u2019s presidential and congressional elections. In January the government said it was setting up a work group to combat fake news made up of federal police officers, electoral court officials and prosecutors. Folha is the biggest newspaper in this continent-sized country of 209 million people, with 285,000 print and digital sales and 204m page impressions last December, according to the Communication Verification Institute, or IVC, a non-profit media auditor. But fewer people are accessing it from Facebook, the IVC said. During the last six months of 2017, access to Brazil\u2019s biggest news sites via Facebook fell from about 9% to 7%, IVC\u2019s president, Pedro Silva, told the Guardian, quoting unpublished research. Access to news sites via Facebook fell even further in the week beginning 22 January, when an appeal by former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva against a sentence for corruption and money laundering was being heard. That same week, Folha\u2019s digital audience grew, he said. Facebook did not immediately reply to requests for comment. In defending the algorithm change in January, Zuckerberg said that \u201cposts from businesses, brands and media\u201d were \u201ccrowding out the personal moments that lead us to connect more with each other\u201d. The change meant people spent 50m hours less on Facebook, Zuckerberg later said. Brazil is Facebook\u2019s third biggest market in the world, with 130 million users, according to statistics portal Statista.",

The Grand Lodge also said that nobody who joined the journalists\u2019 lodge since 2000 had recorded their profession as a journalist. In its advert, the Grand Lodge said it valued honesty, integrity and service to the community above all else, and that last year its members raised more than \u00a333m for good causes. \u201cAs an organisation we welcome individuals from all walks of life, of any race, faith, age, class or political persuasion. Throughout our 300-year history, when people have suffered discrimination Freemasonry has embraced them into our lodge as equals.\u201d After the Guardian asked Freemasons to share their experiences of the organisation, a number wrote to echo these values. Peter, from London, a member for more than 20 years, said his lodge was quite diverse: \u201cWe have Catholics, Buddhists, Jews, Hindus and several Muslims. We are also proudly represented by brethren who are transparent members of the LGBT demographic. \u201cThough women have their own lodge I think the Grand Lodge will one day fully modernise and allow both sexes to mix \u2013 which will be great for the whole organisation and a day I look forward to. \u201cMy work colleagues know I am a member and they haven\u2019t batted an eyelid. I haven\u2019t met any brother who refuses to share the knowledge of their membership and what we do there. I guess that\u2019s quite surprisingly, well, ordinary.\u201d A Freemason and member of the police in south-west England, who asked to remain anonymous, said his lodge was \u201cneither subversive, controlling, misogynistic or a cause for concern\u201d. \u201cI was a slightly sceptical about the secret \u2018Illuminati-esque\u2019 image when I first joined but was disabused of the notion,\u201d he said. \u201cMasonry is steeped in tradition and its rituals are peculiar, but no more so than those in the Catholic Church.\u201d In media interviews, Staples has also claimed that an investigation by the Commons home affairs select committee concluded that there was \u201cnothing sinister\u201d about Freemasonry in Britain. The investigation, in the late 1990s, concluded that \u201cthere are cases where allegations of improper masonic influence may well be justified\u201d and recommended that Freemasons in the police, local government and parliament be required to declare their membership.",

      "body": "<p>A Neolithic monument has been discovered less than two miles from Windsor Castle. Dating from 5,500 years ago, it is one of the earliest known examples of monument-building in Britain. </p> <p>A ceremonial gathering place known as a causewayed enclosure has been revealed with the discovery of a series of encircling ditches, artificial boundaries with gap entrances, at a vast site in Berkshire.</p> <p>Archaeologists have found extensive quantities of animal bones as well as decorated pottery sherds, and evidence that pots were deliberately smashed, perhaps as festivities came to a boisterous close. Other finds include finely worked, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes and grinding stones.</p> <p>About 80 Neolithic monuments have been identified in Britain, but archaeologists are particularly excited by this one as they expect to uncover the entire circuit of the enclosure. Specialists from <a href=\"http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/\">Wessex Archaeology</a> made the discovery at a sand and gravel quarry near Datchet, within sight of Windsor Castle.</p> <p>John Powell, a fieldwork director for Wessex Archaeology, said: \u201cThis is an exciting find. We\u2019re talking about 5,500 years ago. These are earliest peoples, who are actually settling down in the landscape and leaving their mark on it. So it\u2019s quite an impressive thing to be able to excavate.</p> <p>\u201cOften when they\u2019re found now in modern conditions, you might only find part of the circuit. On this site, its position within the quarry means that we\u2019ll be able to investigate pretty much all of the enclosure. So that will mean we\u2019ve got a much better picture and an understanding of the site as a whole.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/15/stonehenge-neolithic-man-sweet-pork-rich-cheese-feasts\">What did neolithic workers eat after a hard day at Stonehenge? Sweet pork and rich cheese</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The monument is on a slightly raised area in what may have been a marshy or seasonally wet landscape within the Thames floodplain. Powell said the area had been settled for thousands of years. \u201cSo we were going there expecting to find prehistoric remains, but we didn\u2019t expect to find such a large monument on the site. We\u2019ve worked on a few other quarries in the area and found small settlements, evidence of field ditches and small houses, but not these larger communal monuments.</p> <p>\u201cSome causewayed enclosures don\u2019t contain much in the way of artefacts, whereas this one seems very rich in artefacts, which will be significant for the understanding of the early Neolithic in Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The pottery sherds have delicate decorative marks that may have been created with bird bones or twisted cord. The archaeologists plan to test deposits found in the vessels, to learn what was cooked in or drunk from them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5da4695dbf6d5f6513346cadf88c484accb7bc25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5da4695dbf6d5f6513346cadf88c484accb7bc25/0_192_5394_3236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pottery fragments from the site\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pottery fragments from the site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Powell said other complete monuments had been found before, including the nearby Staines enclosure, but that was only partially excavated in the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s now all been destroyed because the M25 runs over the top of it.

      "bodyText": "A Neolithic monument has been discovered less than two miles from Windsor Castle. Dating from 5,500 years ago, it is one of the earliest known examples of monument-building in Britain. A ceremonial gathering place known as a causewayed enclosure has been revealed with the discovery of a series of encircling ditches, artificial boundaries with gap entrances, at a vast site in Berkshire. Archaeologists have found extensive quantities of animal bones as well as decorated pottery sherds, and evidence that pots were deliberately smashed, perhaps as festivities came to a boisterous close. Other finds include finely worked, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes and grinding stones. About 80 Neolithic monuments have been identified in Britain, but archaeologists are particularly excited by this one as they expect to uncover the entire circuit of the enclosure. Specialists from Wessex Archaeology made the discovery at a sand and gravel quarry near Datchet, within sight of Windsor Castle. John Powell, a fieldwork director for Wessex Archaeology, said: \u201cThis is an exciting find. We\u2019re talking about 5,500 years ago. These are earliest peoples, who are actually settling down in the landscape and leaving their mark on it. So it\u2019s quite an impressive thing to be able to excavate. \u201cOften when they\u2019re found now in modern conditions, you might only find part of the circuit. On this site, its position within the quarry means that we\u2019ll be able to investigate pretty much all of the enclosure. So that will mean we\u2019ve got a much better picture and an understanding of the site as a whole.\u201d The monument is on a slightly raised area in what may have been a marshy or seasonally wet landscape within the Thames floodplain. Powell said the area had been settled for thousands of years. \u201cSo we were going there expecting to find prehistoric remains, but we didn\u2019t expect to find such a large monument on the site. We\u2019ve worked on a few other quarries in the area and found small settlements, evidence of field ditches and small houses, but not these larger communal monuments. \u201cSome causewayed enclosures don\u2019t contain much in the way of artefacts, whereas this one seems very rich in artefacts, which will be significant for the understanding of the early Neolithic in Britain.\u201d The pottery sherds have delicate decorative marks that may have been created with bird bones or twisted cord. The archaeologists plan to test deposits found in the vessels, to learn what was cooked in or drunk from them. Powell said other complete monuments had been found before, including the nearby Staines enclosure, but that was only partially excavated in the 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s now all been destroyed because the M25 runs over the top of it. Now this is a chance to excavate an enclosure under modern conditions and using modern techniques.\u201d Excavations conducted so far suggest the monument was oval in shape with a projected perimeter of 500 metres (1,640ft), larger than an athletics track. Currently 265 metres of the enclosure\u2019s arc \u2013 12 ditch segments \u2013 have been traced, and the remainder could be uncovered later this year. One theory is that it was seasonally occupied, with communities gathering for ceremonial feasting, exchanging goods and social obligations. Human remains have also been found at the site. Jacqueline McKinley, Wessex Archaeology\u2019s principal osteoarchaeologist, said the bones showed evidence of postmortem human manipulation of a body. \u201cThe skull and left femur had been removed from one individual and cut marks are visible on a skull that had been deliberately placed on the bottom of the ditch. Further work may allow us to understand both the treatment and shifting roles played by the dead in Neolithic communities.\u201d Asked about the animal bones, Powell said: \u201cCattle dominate the assemblage and we also have pig and sheep or goat from the domesticated farming side. Wild species are also present and include red and roe deer, as well as some fox bones.\u201d He said these suggested the hunter gatherer was settling down, bringing farming into the area, domesticating animals, making pottery and mining flint. The archaeology is part of the planning conditions on the quarry, which is owned and run by Cemex UK, a supplier of cement, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt. The archaeological programme is monitored on behalf of the local planning authority by Berkshire Archaeology. Roland Smith of Berkshire Archaeology said: \u201cThis is such an exciting and important discovery in the royal borough. The excavation of this monument will add so much to our shared human story, especially [about] this pivotal time in the earliest years of farming in Britain.\u201d Archaeologists have found remains from several periods of prehistoric, Roman and later activity. People are thought to have periodically lived or gathered in the area since the end of the last ice age, a period of 12,000 years.",

Nearly one in five people (19%) working at Westminster have experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the past year, it found. The report calls for urgent reform of a culture of harassment and bullying at Westminster, with a new complaints procedure and an investigation mechanism independent of parties. The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, who chairs the working group behind the report, said MPs found to have bullied or abused staff would face \u201creal sanctions\u201d for breaching a proposed code of conduct. Launching the report in the Commons, she said: \u201cWe all recognise the need for robust procedures to change the culture in parliament and for this place to set the best example of a workplace that protects and supports all those working in it.\u201d It recommends that the names of those accused of sexual harassment and bullying should remain confidential while allegations are investigated, but disclosed if abuse is proven. Under the proposed system, complaints would trigger a confidential inquiry by the parliamentary commissioner for standards, with a tougher range of sanctions for those found to have behaved inappropriately. On receiving the commissioner\u2019s report, standards committees in the Commons and the House of Lords would be able to recommend the suspension of an MP or peer for a specified period. This could trigger proceedings for the recall of an MP, resulting in an election in their constituency, or the expulsion of a peer. The survey of 1,377 workers found 39% of staff, MPs and peers had experienced non-sexual bullying and harassment of some sort while on the parliamentary estate.

      "bodyText": "One of the wilder conspiracy theories I have seen was in a neo-Nazi newspaper in the mid-1990s in Moscow. The article revealed that Boris Yeltsin and Mikhail Gorbachev were both assumed names and that the men had been born Baruch Yeltzer and Mikhail Solomonovich Gorbachev (his real patronymic is Sergeyevich). In other words, the architects of Russian misery after the collapse of the Soviet Union were secret Jews. This was outlandish even by the standards of eastern European antisemitism. It was also hypermarginal in the media. You had to buy pamphlets on the street to read about plots to dilute the purity of the Russian race by a cabal of Jews/Zionists (the two words were interchangeable). Then came the internet. These days you are never more than a couple of clicks away from weapons-grade antisemitism. But it still comes as a shock when one of the oldest and most versatile themes of the genre \u2013 the Jewish financier, dandling politicians on puppet strings, coordinating events in the shadows \u2013 finds its way on to the front page of a national British newspaper. To be clear: I am not charging any individuals at the Daily Telegraph with willingly promoting hatred of Jews or writing with that agenda in mind. I have no idea what went on in the heads of the people who wrote this morning\u2019s splash headline: \u201cMan who \u2018broke the Bank of England\u2019 backing secret plot to thwart Brexit\u201d. Nor do I know what discussions went on in the newsroom as they laid out the pages and assembled the package to include accounts of George Soros\u2019s financial involvement in the politics of other countries. That copy includes the observation that his foundation is \u201caccused of toppling governments in Georgia and Ukraine\u201d and that, while he denies the allegations, not everyone is convinced that Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation (OSF) is the philanthropic promoter of liberal values it professes to be. His denials, the Telegraph notes, have \u201cnot stopped the OSF being banned from Russia and Uzbekistan\u201d. As if the autocratic regimes in Moscow and Tashkent need real provocation to obstruct civil society organisations. From this, a reader might well infer that there is something of the night about this Soros character; no smoke without fire. Besides, what is this foreign man, who once made a packet trading against the mighty sterling, doing sticking his nose into Brexit? And, of all things, in \u201csecret\u201d, in the shadows, where svengalis lurk. (Although in reality Soros\u2019s interest in the remain cause was publicly available knowledge.) Nowhere does the Telegraph say that Soros is Jewish. But to a particular audience \u2013 to those whose antennae are attuned to the high-frequency signal \u2013 it goes without saying. That is the subtext, and often the actual text, in officially sanctioned, orchestrated attacks on Soros in Poland, Hungary (where he was born), and other eastern European countries. He has earned this opprobrium by supporting, via Open Society, liberal politics and by resisting authoritarian measures that corrode the rule of law and stifle political pluralism. To the radical nationalist governments in those countries he has become the arch bogeyman. And a vintage bogeyman it is, too: the all-powerful internationalist Jew with no organic connection to the soil of nationhood; the embodiment of demonic, wandering, predatory capital; the new uber-Rothschild. Soviet propagandists called Jews \u201crootless cosmopolitans\u201d. Soros\u2019s name turns up in far-right protests across the former eastern bloc, but also in the US, where he is a hate figure for Trumpian ultras. He has been accused of paying for anti-Trump protests. He has been accused of meddling in the US election. He has been accused of trying to dilute Christian white culture in Europe by orchestrating influxes of Muslim refugees. And now he is accused by the Daily Telegraph of conspiring against Brexit. A busy man indeed. The fact that Soros is supporting an anti-Brexit movement is newsworthy. It was reported in the Guardian, but not draped in the idiom of conspiracy.

      "bodyText": "The biggest revelations in New York magazine\u2019s infinitely quotable interview with Quincy Jones were not about Quincy Jones. They were about Marlon Brando (\u201che\u2019d fuck a mailbox\u201d), JFK (Jones knows who killed him \u2013 as much as he wishes he didn\u2019t) and Ringo Starr (can\u2019t drum \u2013 \u201cgreat guy, though\u201d). That got us thinking: what other celebrity interviews got everyone talking? In chronological order ... Richey Edwards of Manic Street Preachers, NME, 1991 Journalist Steve Lamacq\u2019s interview with Edwards after a gig at the Norwich Arts Centre on 15 May 1991 became infamous when Edwards carved \u201c4 REAL\u201d into his arm with a razor blade. NME deliberated for some time whether to print the lurid pictures, eventually running one in black and white alongside a news story and Lamacq\u2019s review of the gig. Neither appear to have made it into the internet age, but in any case, they were eclipsed by subsequent interviews, about the interview. Drew Barrymore, The Late Show with David Letterman, 1995 Barrymore flashing Letterman remains one of his show\u2019s most memorable moments. She has returned as a guest many times since and confirmed in 2015 that her \u201clittle dance number ... was completely spontaneous and not calculated in any way\u201d. The top comment beneath the clip on YouTube? \u201cI love the 90s\u201d. John Rocker, Sports Illustrated, 1999 This interview made Rocker, the former Major League Baseball pitcher, a household name, for all the wrong reasons. After Rocker\u2019s Atlanta Braves lost the World Series to the Yankees, his venomous attack on New York and New Yorkers made him the poster boy for homophobia, xenophobia ... it goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s the most hectic, nerve-racking city. Imagine having to take the 7 train to the ballpark looking like you\u2019re [riding through] Beirut next to some kid with purple hair next to some queer with Aids right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It\u2019s depressing \u2026 The biggest thing I don\u2019t like about New York are the foreigners.\u201d Rocker was suspended without pay for the first 28 games of the season (reduced to 14 games upon appeal), but never quite lived his remarks down, no matter what he said to Entertainment Weekly in 2014, ahead of his appearance on Survivor: San Juan del Sur. \u201cMy current and past teammates liked me so much they would come to my adamant defense after that article. I think once these people get to know me, they will be willing to defend me as well.\u201d Marianne Faithfull, the Observer, 2001 \u201cI\u2019m already fed up with her and we haven\u2019t even started,\u201d wrote Lynn Barber of Marianne Faithfull. The now-legendary interview goes from bad to worse, and, Barber wrote in A Curious Career, \u201chad a strange afterlife\u201d. Faithfull claimed that Barber had asked her if she\u2019d ever had sex with a dog; Barber denied doing any such thing: \u201cIt would never occur to me in a million years to ask if she\u2019d had sex with a dog, because it would never occur to me in a million years that she might have had sex with a dog. Where would I get such an idea?\u201d Dov Charney, Jane, 2004 \u2018Are you going to do it again?\u2019 I ask. \u2018Can I?\u2019 he says, adjusting himself in his chair. \u201cAnd thus begins another compulsive episode of what Dov likes to call self pleasure, during which we casually carry on our interview, discussing things like business models, hiring practices and the stupidity of focus groups.\u201d Claudine Ko\u2019s brutally honest account of her interview with the now-notorious chief executive of American Apparel is as excruciating to read now as it was 14 years ago. Pair it with Hadley Freeman\u2019s G2 interview with Charney from 2017. George Michael, the Guardian, 2005 and 2009 During Simon Hattenstone\u2019s second interview with Michael, over some wine at his home in Highgate, Michael recalls a slight from the first, four years ago: \u201cYou said I looked pinched then.\u201d Both are wonderfully revealing. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give many interviews, but when he did he really did give good interview,\u201d wrote Hattenstone after Michael\u2019s death in 2016. \u201cFew pop stars let you anywhere near their real life; Michael showed you everything when the time was right.\u201d (For a less cordial encounter, revisit Hattenstone\u2019s interview with Lou Reed in 2003: \u201cNot a perfect day\u201d.) John Mayer, Playboy, 2010 Mayer\u2019s Rolling Stone interview in January 2010, with its head-scratching reference to \u201cthe Joshua Tree of vaginas\u201d, was all anyone could talk about \u2013 until John Mayer\u2019s Playboy interview in February 2010. It set a new personal best in outrageous over-sharing for the Your Body is a Wonderland singer with the line: \u201cMy dick is sort of like a white supremacist.\u201d As Talib Kweli observed on Twitter: \u201cJohn Mayer must love the taste of his own foot.\u201d Charlie Sheen, ABC, 2011 You remember the one: \u201cI am on a drug. It\u2019s called Charlie Sheen. It is not available because if you try it once you will die. Your face will melt off and your children will weep over your exploded body.\u201d Chris Evans, GQ, 2011 Best known as Captain America, Evans\u2019 profile may be the lesser of the three Chrises \u2013 Pratt and Hemsworth complete the trifecta \u2013 but you don\u2019t need to be able to pick him out from a line-up to enjoy this interview with him by Edith Zimmerman. Beginning with explicit flirtation (\u201cSince we\u2019re both single and roughly the same age, it was hard for me not to treat our interview as a sort of date\u201d) and ending with Zimmerman passed out in Evans\u2019 guest bedroom, it is a fangirling fever dream \u2013 a celebrity interview as imagined by someone who\u2019s never interviewed a celebrity before. At the time it was published, it sparked much debate about whether it was \u201cresponsible journalism\u201d. It remains a delight to read. Quentin Tarantino, Channel 4, 2013 \u201cI\u2019m shutting your butt down!\u201d The director was not happy to discuss the link between the cinematic violence of Django Unchained and real-life violence in this heated interview by Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Michael Douglas, the Guardian, 2013 Douglas\u2019s passing remark about the cause of his cancer was so mind-boggling it demanded publication of the relevant audio clip, a doctor\u2019s right of reply, and the Guardian\u2019s firm rejection of charges of misrepresentation. Journalist Xan Brooks spoke for every reader in his final paragraph: \u201cI\u2019m still thinking about what he said earlier, about HPV and oral sex and how it can be both cause and cure. Can that last bit be right?\u201d Kanye West, BBC Radio 1, 2015 West\u2019s two-part interview with Zane Lowe \u2013 on Kanye, Ikea, Kanye, Disney, Kanye, racism, Kanye, classism, Kanye, Michael Jackson, Kanye, Drake, and did he mention Kanye \u2013 was richly quotable. It inspired a parody by Jimmy Kimmel, which in turn inspired a typically all-caps Twitter rant from West. Tom Hiddleston, GQ, 2017 Taffy Brodesser-Akner \u2013 formerly of GQ, now of the New York Times \u2013 is the master of the dry, understated celebrity profile, where the real insights are in between the lines. Her account of Tom Hiddleston \u2013 breathless, eager-to-please, and visiting her hotel room at dawn to explain himself further \u2013 may have done more damage to his chances at playing Bond than that \u201cI &lt;3 TS\u201d singlet.

Before I left for the train, my children\u2019s babysitter dug in her bag and handed me her Mace, which I felt compelled to accept with the words: \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s hilarious.\u201d Soberly, she replied: \u201cPeople are terrible.\u201d In fact, he wasn\u2019t. He was very nice. But considering the alternative didn\u2019t feel like a piece of self-victimisation. It felt like a necessary and overdue widening of the lens. \u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist",

Business secretary Greg Clark has spoken on an impartial basis to both companies.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson added that the takeover code, which governs corporate mergers and acquisitions, had been strengthened to \u201cgive companies subject to a bid more time to prepare their response\u201d. </p> <p>Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has urged Clark to stop the takeover, which she said would \u201crisk weakening our industrial base and diminishing our national defence capabilities\u201d.</p> <p>The former business secretary Vince Cable warned earlier this week that Melrose was an \u201casset-stripper\u201d whose bid for GKN posed a \u201cserious threat\u201d to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper\">UK industrial strategy</a>. The Liberal Democrat leader\u2019s comment is understood to refer to Melrose\u2019s strategy of taking over underperforming companies and stripping out inefficient layers of management or selling less profitable assets.</p> <p>A deal for GKN would be its largest and most controversial to date, given the firm\u2019s work in areas that involve the UK military.</p> <p>GKN works in automotive, metallurgy and aerospace, including sensitive areas such as technology for the US defence company Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35B fighter jet, 138 of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/04/f-35-stealth-jet-fighter-uk-faces-billions-extra-cost\">have been ordered</a> for the Royal Air Force.</p> <p>The company, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and traces its history back to 1759, has struggled in recent years and issued a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/gkn-chief-executive-writedown-kevin-cummings\">profit warning</a> after a downturn in its US aerospace business.</p> <p>GKN has proposed splitting into two rather than accepting the offer from Melrose, whose chief executive, Simon Peckham, has said the decision is \u201cdown to the shareholders now\u201d.</p> <p>Melrose, founded in 2003, said it would not pursue a \u201chasty\u201d split of the automotive and aerospace divisions, but would sell small parts of GKN to \u201csimplify and declutter\u201d the business.</p> <p>In a proposal document sent to shareholders, Melrose insisted it would take its national security obligations seriously if the cash-plus-shares offer succeeded.</p> <p>\u201cAs an established UK public company with relevant experience, we fully recognise our requirements in this regard and have no doubt that this is completely compatible with our approach,\u201d the company said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs have asked the government whether it will consider using powers to block takeovers for national security reasons to stop a hostile bid for the engineering company GKN, which makes technology used in the F-35 fighter jet. GKN has rejected as \u201cderisory\u201d a \u00a37bn offer from the turnaround specialist Melrose after it appealed directly to shareholders rather than seeking consent from the company\u2019s management. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, has written to the business secretary, Greg Clark, to ask whether the government has considered using its powers to block the deal. The appeal follows an assurance from Theresa May earlier this week that the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) would be \u201clooking closely\u201d at the proposed takeover. In her letter to Clark, Reeves asked for \u201cmore detail about the nature of the discussions you have had with the chief executives of both GKN and Melrose\u201d. \u201cIn particular, have you established whether there are sufficient grounds for you to intervene in the public interest on the grounds of national security?\u201d she wrote. She also asked whether Clark, who is weighing up adding to Whitehall\u2019s powers to block takeovers, to consider \u201cwidening the scope\u201d for government intervention. \u201cFor example, in other countries, such as Germany, I understand that the law requires a qualified majority of 75% of votes cast for certain actions associated with a hostile takeover,\u201d Reeves wrote. She also asked whether the government would reopen proposals to limit the ability of shareholders to vote on takeovers if they have only recently bought shares. Reeves referred to the controversial \u00a312bn takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010, when hedge funds and other speculators were accused of buying up shares in the chocolate-maker so that they could vote in favour of a deal and make a quick profit. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWhile this is a commercial matter for the companies involved, government is closely monitoring the situation. Business secretary Greg Clark has spoken on an impartial basis to both companies.\u201d The spokesperson added that the takeover code, which governs corporate mergers and acquisitions, had been strengthened to \u201cgive companies subject to a bid more time to prepare their response\u201d. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, has urged Clark to stop the takeover, which she said would \u201crisk weakening our industrial base and diminishing our national defence capabilities\u201d. The former business secretary Vince Cable warned earlier this week that Melrose was an \u201casset-stripper\u201d whose bid for GKN posed a \u201cserious threat\u201d to the UK industrial strategy. The Liberal Democrat leader\u2019s comment is understood to refer to Melrose\u2019s strategy of taking over underperforming companies and stripping out inefficient layers of management or selling less profitable assets. A deal for GKN would be its largest and most controversial to date, given the firm\u2019s work in areas that involve the UK military. GKN works in automotive, metallurgy and aerospace, including sensitive areas such as technology for the US defence company Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35B fighter jet, 138 of which have been ordered for the Royal Air Force. The company, which used to be known as Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds and traces its history back to 1759, has struggled in recent years and issued a profit warning after a downturn in its US aerospace business. GKN has proposed splitting into two rather than accepting the offer from Melrose, whose chief executive, Simon Peckham, has said the decision is \u201cdown to the shareholders now\u201d. Melrose, founded in 2003, said it would not pursue a \u201chasty\u201d split of the automotive and aerospace divisions, but would sell small parts of GKN to \u201csimplify and declutter\u201d the business. In a proposal document sent to shareholders, Melrose insisted it would take its national security obligations seriously if the cash-plus-shares offer succeeded. \u201cAs an established UK public company with relevant experience, we fully recognise our requirements in this regard and have no doubt that this is completely compatible with our approach,\u201d the company said.",

The shadow chancellor seized on reports that Surrey \u2013 where the Runneymede and Weybridge constituency of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is located \u2013 was facing a \u00a3100m cash crisis. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism identified Surrey as the council facing the largest gap between expected revenues and expenditures in the coming financial year. The average deficit at the 150 councils the bureau examined was \u00a314.7m. Meanwhile, a survey of senior council officials by the Local Government Information Unit thinktank found that almost 80% had no confidence in the future sustainability of council finances. McDonnell said: \u201cIf you ever wanted to see the utter failure of this government, look no further than your local council. Many are struggling to maintain many basic services because they are being forced to pass on Tory cuts. \u201cThere needs to be an urgent change of direction in local government funding in this country. We need to see an end to a situation whereby Tory governments are using local councils like human shields as they continue to drive ahead with their failed austerity agenda.\u201d McDonnell appeared at a conference in Preston alongside the shadow communities secretary, Andrew Gwynne. Many of the councils under greatest financial pressure are in Tory-held areas, and Conservative MPs have put pressure on the government to relieve the squeeze in particular areas. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, announced an extra \u00a3150m this week specifically to be spent on social care in areas of greatest need, amid a growing backlash from backbenchers. But council leaders said it would not be enough to meet rapidly increasing needs. The LGIU\u2019s survey of councils\u2019 finances suggested that 94% are planning to raise council tax in the coming year to make ends meet, and 65% will be dipping into their financial reserves. In his speech, McDonnell highlighted alternative approaches to delivering local services. Labour believes the threat to council services, such as social care and support for children, are the latest stark illustration of the ongoing impact of austerity. The government has promised to put social care funding on a sustainable footing; but a green paper on the issue is not due to be published until next summer.",

Churchill was a frequent visitor to Western Approaches, the secret bunker under Liverpool that has been reopened by Chester-based social enterprise group Big Heritage. It was the nerve centre to coordinate the Battle of the Atlantic and staffed mainly by Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) and Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force, (WAAFs). The bunker is in the basement of an office building in Moorfields, Liverpool\u2019s business quarter, but is just five minutes from Pier Head and the waterfront. Combine it with a visit to the Terracotta Warriors <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/wml/exhibitions/terracotta-warriors/index.aspx\">at the World Museum</a>, opening on 9 February, for a thoroughly educational day out.</p> <h2>Fun fact</h2> <p>Western Approaches houses the original Gaumont Kalee Dragon projector Churchill used to watch secret war footage.

The self-guided trail goes through a labyrinth of rooms, including the central Operations Room with its giant battle map and the Cypher Room, where secret coded messages were exchanged with Bletchley Park. The tour ends at a recreated 1940s Liverpool street scene, where families can dress up in period clothes before hitting the sweet shop. There\u2019s a new room for half-term devoted to children\u2019s games, such as hopscotch, cup and ball, and pitch and toss with genuine old pennies. Grandparents will no doubt enjoy beating the kids at their wartime favourite.</p> <h2>What about lunch?</h2> <p>At the low-key Naafi (canteen), a cup of tea or coffee costs 2p \u2013 as it did in 1940 \u2013 making it the cheapest cuppa in the city, perhaps the country.

      "bodyText": "In a nutshell With Gary Oldman Oscar nominated for his performance as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, the UK\u2019s war-time leader is in focus. Churchill was a frequent visitor to Western Approaches, the secret bunker under Liverpool that has been reopened by Chester-based social enterprise group Big Heritage. It was the nerve centre to coordinate the Battle of the Atlantic and staffed mainly by Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service (WRNS) and Women\u2019s Auxiliary Air Force, (WAAFs). The bunker is in the basement of an office building in Moorfields, Liverpool\u2019s business quarter, but is just five minutes from Pier Head and the waterfront. Combine it with a visit to the Terracotta Warriors at the World Museum, opening on 9 February, for a thoroughly educational day out. Fun fact Western Approaches houses the original Gaumont Kalee Dragon projector Churchill used to watch secret war footage. Newsreel controlled by the Ministry of Information was then shown to the public in cinemas to boost morale. Best things about it It captures the bulldog spirit of the times. The self-guided trail goes through a labyrinth of rooms, including the central Operations Room with its giant battle map and the Cypher Room, where secret coded messages were exchanged with Bletchley Park. The tour ends at a recreated 1940s Liverpool street scene, where families can dress up in period clothes before hitting the sweet shop. There\u2019s a new room for half-term devoted to children\u2019s games, such as hopscotch, cup and ball, and pitch and toss with genuine old pennies. Grandparents will no doubt enjoy beating the kids at their wartime favourite. What about lunch? At the low-key Naafi (canteen), a cup of tea or coffee costs 2p \u2013 as it did in 1940 \u2013 making it the cheapest cuppa in the city, perhaps the country. While sipping you can peruse wartime history books, or watch the video about Merseyside during wartime. Speaking after the Liverpool blitz of May 1941, Churchill said, \u201cI see \u2026 the spirit of an unconquered people.\u201d Exit through the gift shop? A small shop in reception has souvenirs on a wartime theme, including Morse Code kits (\u00a317.50) and Chocolate Edition Battleships games (\u00a39). Our family favourite was a Churchill-style rubber duck \u2013 complete with cigar and victory sign (\u00a35.50) \u2013 to remember the night the former prime minister coordinated strategy from the bathtub. Getting there It is walking distance from Liverpool Moorfields and Lime Street railway stations, both served by the Merseyrail network. If driving, there\u2019s pay-and-display parking on Rumford Street, opposite the museum. Value for money? It\u2019s still a bit work-in-progress but the ticket is valid over six months for repeat visits: \u00a310.50 adults, \u00a39 concessions (senior citizens, students, serving personnel and children aged 5-16), under 5s free, family ticket (2+2) \u00a330. A guided tour of the site for groups or individuals costs \u00a320 per hour. Opening hours Open 10am-5pm (last admission 4.15pm, closed Wednesdays). Verdict 8 out of 10.

      "bodyText": "Twitter has posted its first quarterly profit in the company\u2019s 12-year history, although a clampdown on fake accounts meant it lost users in the US and overall user growth stalled. The San Francisco-based social network, which went public five years ago, made a profit of $91m (\u00a365m) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a $167m loss a year earlier, after cutting costs. It also returned to revenue growth as video ad sales rose, with revenue up 2% year on year to $732m. Twitter\u2019s annual loss shrank to $108m from $457m in 2016. It expects to make its first annual profit this year. Shares jumped more than 20% on the news. However, the site favoured by Donald Trump, celebrities and politicians struggled to increase user numbers, despite the publicity created by the president\u2019s frequent tweets. In a letter to shareholders, Twitter said it had stepped up efforts to reduce spam, automated accounts known as bots and fake accounts. The company had 330 million monthly active users in the quarter, up 4% year on year, but growth stalled compared with the previous quarter. The number was below the 332.5 million expected by Wall Street. A change that Apple made to its Safari web browser reduced the tally by 2 million. In the US, where Twitter makes most of its revenue, the number of users dipped to 68 million from 69 million in the third quarter. The network faces tough competition from bigger rivals such as Facebook, which has 2.1 billion monthly users, along with more recent arrivals including Snapchat and Instagram. Twitter has introduced measures to tackle abuse and has said that it \u201ccares deeply\u201d about misinformation and its harmful effect on civic discourse. But Michael Connor, whose Open Mic group recently helped two large Twitter and Facebook shareholders file resolutions asking the companies to take more responsibility for fake news, abuse and hate speech, said Twitter was not doing enough to address these issues. \u201cThey are playing whack-a-mole with these problems,\u201d he told AP. \u201cThey say they have the problem under control, but they don\u2019t know what the problem is exactly.\u201d Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, has in the past year tweaked the product he co-founded to attract more users. Twitter doubled the number of characters allowed in each tweet in most languages, from 140 to 280. It also signed deals with media companies to live-stream news, sports events and entertainment shows.",

To turn the pages of their books is to travel into other worlds, to discover and marvel, and to want to return again and again for another visit.\u201d </p> <p>He praised in particular Burningham\u2019s Oi Get Off My Train, and Oxenbury\u2019s illustrations for We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt. \u201cThey are works of two great artist/storytellers. They make books you never forget, that you hold in your head and heart, as enjoyable for the grownup child often reading them out aloud, and the smaller child, listening and looking, lost in words and pictures.\u201d</p> <p>Rosen, who wrote the text for Bear Hunt, said that Oxenbury had reinvented the picture book for the very youngest children, adding: \u201c[She] turned my adaptation of a folk chant into a great existential quest.\u201d Judith Kerr, the author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea and winner of the BookTrust award in 2016, said that Burningham\u2019s Humbert, about a working horse who pulls the Lord Mayor\u2019s coach, had inspired her to become an illustrator. \u201cMore than 50 years later it is still one of the best picture books ever produced for children,\u201d she said.<br></p> <p>Burningham said he was \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d to win the prize: \u201cI\u2019m so very flattered when I hear people now say they love my books and that something I did 50 years ago still works and is enjoyed by their family.\u201d Oxenbury said it was \u201cparticularly lovely\u201d to win the prize jointly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/05/how-we-made-bear-hunt\">How we made: Helen Oxenbury and Michael Rosen on We're Going on a Bear Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked what they believe it is in their books that has managed to appeal to children over the decades, Burningham said: \u201cI would say that they know one\u2019s on their side. Children are not less intelligent, they\u2019re just less experienced, and there is this rather silly attitude that can be adopted, that \u2018Oh it\u2019s for children, it\u2019s got to be pink coloured cakes or lots of pattern everywhere, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll like\u2019, and they\u2019re bored. And if they don\u2019t like it they simply won\u2019t look at it.\u201d</p> <p>Oxenbury said: \u201cIt\u2019s very much the same as us reading an adult book; it\u2019s the same requirement. You\u2019ve got to grab them very quickly or else \u2013 you know children \u2013 they just chuck it away. They want to instantly be involved. They\u2019re horribly honest. They used to think that little tiny children couldn\u2019t get anything out of a picture book, but they now know that there\u2019s an amazing amount they get out of it. They\u2019re like sponges, they just suck up information, even at the age of four months, six months.\u201d</p> <p>Despite being married for more than 50 years, the pair have collaborated on only one book \u2013 2010\u2019s There\u2019s Going to Be a Baby<em>. </em> \u201cIt\u2019s much easier if we don\u2019t really,\u201d said Burningham, who works on the ground floor of their home, while Oxenbury has an outside studio. They do show each other drawings that they aren\u2019t quite happy with. \u201cI\u2019ll say to John, \u2018What do you think of this?\u2019 And it\u2019ll be something that has proved to be very difficult and I\u2019ve spent a long time over it, and all he says is, \u2018Absolutely no good.\u2019 It\u2019s terribly depressing and you have to start again.

To turn the pages of their books is to travel into other worlds, to discover and marvel, and to want to return again and again for another visit.\u201d He praised in particular Burningham\u2019s Oi Get Off My Train, and Oxenbury\u2019s illustrations for We\u2019re Going on a Bear Hunt. \u201cThey are works of two great artist/storytellers. They make books you never forget, that you hold in your head and heart, as enjoyable for the grownup child often reading them out aloud, and the smaller child, listening and looking, lost in words and pictures.\u201d Rosen, who wrote the text for Bear Hunt, said that Oxenbury had reinvented the picture book for the very youngest children, adding: \u201c[She] turned my adaptation of a folk chant into a great existential quest.\u201d Judith Kerr, the author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea and winner of the BookTrust award in 2016, said that Burningham\u2019s Humbert, about a working horse who pulls the Lord Mayor\u2019s coach, had inspired her to become an illustrator. \u201cMore than 50 years later it is still one of the best picture books ever produced for children,\u201d she said. Burningham said he was \u201cincredibly grateful\u201d to win the prize: \u201cI\u2019m so very flattered when I hear people now say they love my books and that something I did 50 years ago still works and is enjoyed by their family.\u201d Oxenbury said it was \u201cparticularly lovely\u201d to win the prize jointly. Asked what they believe it is in their books that has managed to appeal to children over the decades, Burningham said: \u201cI would say that they know one\u2019s on their side. Children are not less intelligent, they\u2019re just less experienced, and there is this rather silly attitude that can be adopted, that \u2018Oh it\u2019s for children, it\u2019s got to be pink coloured cakes or lots of pattern everywhere, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll like\u2019, and they\u2019re bored. And if they don\u2019t like it they simply won\u2019t look at it.\u201d Oxenbury said: \u201cIt\u2019s very much the same as us reading an adult book; it\u2019s the same requirement. You\u2019ve got to grab them very quickly or else \u2013 you know children \u2013 they just chuck it away. They want to instantly be involved. They\u2019re horribly honest. They used to think that little tiny children couldn\u2019t get anything out of a picture book, but they now know that there\u2019s an amazing amount they get out of it. They\u2019re like sponges, they just suck up information, even at the age of four months, six months.\u201d Despite being married for more than 50 years, the pair have collaborated on only one book \u2013 2010\u2019s There\u2019s Going to Be a Baby. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier if we don\u2019t really,\u201d said Burningham, who works on the ground floor of their home, while Oxenbury has an outside studio. They do show each other drawings that they aren\u2019t quite happy with. \u201cI\u2019ll say to John, \u2018What do you think of this?\u2019 And it\u2019ll be something that has proved to be very difficult and I\u2019ve spent a long time over it, and all he says is, \u2018Absolutely no good.\u2019 It\u2019s terribly depressing and you have to start again. And I do the same for him.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely, yes,\u201d said Burningham. \u201cWe can take it in small doses, but if we worked in the same studio it would be dreadful.\u201d \u201cFeathers would fly,\u201d said Oxenbury. As leading figures in the children\u2019s book world came out to praise Burningham and Oxenbury (\u201cWhat I think they have in common is a tremendous warmth of style and reassuring, gentle humour,\u201d said Cressida Cowell), the pair said that winning a lifetime achievement award did not mean they would be hanging up their paintbrushes. \u201cI am horrible, aren\u2019t I, John, if I\u2019m not working?\u201d said Oxenbury. \u201cDreadful,\u201d said Burningham. \u201cSo I have to carry on,\u201d said Oxenbury. Burningham said he wanted \u201cto die in the saddle\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to stop working on something. I\u2019m very fortunate that I\u2019ve got good eyesight and I haven\u2019t got a trembly hand, so I shall get on with it.\u201d The pair were chosen to receive the BookTrust award by a panel including Waterstones children\u2019s laureate Lauren Child, the author and television presenter Floella Benjamin, and the author and illustrator Anthony Browne.",

      "bodyText": "In the last few years censorship, or indeed the cry thereof, has become something of a meme. Some well-meaning group of people, usually from a demographic that is still struggling to achieve full equality, will raise objections to the meaning of a piece of art or literature, sometimes \u2013 but notably not always \u2013 requesting its removal. And then the rightwing press will go ballistic. Crotchety letters will be written to newspapers, rent-a-gobs will start sharpening their poison pens, those who raised objections will be abused and ridiculed \u2013 and then, after many column inches, everyone will forget about it until the next censorship row comes along. This is what happened in the case of Lola Olufemi, the Cambridge women\u2019s officer who had the temerity to suggest a more diverse, \u201cdecolonised\u201d English curriculum and as a result had her photograph placed on the front page under the headline \u201cStudent forces Cambridge to drop white authors\u201d (the newspaper has since corrected and apologised, as well it should). So often, people such as Olufemi, who was politely making a completely legitimate point about the canon, backed up by a large number of Cambridge academics, are portrayed as hysterical snowflakes who can\u2019t bear differing opinions. And yet it is always the right wing who become pant-wettingly upset about having their views and interpretations challenged. Manchester Art Gallery recently utilised the censorship meme to spectacular effect by temporarily removing John William Waterhouse\u2019s 1896 painting Hylas and the Nymphs in order to prompt a discussion about painting choice in galleries. People duly and predictably went ballistic. Parallels were drawn with Nazi Germany (why choose the Nazis as a comparison? Why not the censorship of the feminist avant-garde?), letters were written to newspapers \u2026 you see where this is going. The painting row came hot on the heels of a row in New York over the display of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Dreaming (1938) by the Polish-French artist Balthasar Klossowski de Rola, which has an 11-year-old girl showing her knickers as its subject. It is no coincidence that both paintings depict what appear to be pre-pubescent girls. The #MeToo movement is in full swing, but even before that we were becoming a society in the process of reappraising its artistic output, not to mention its artists \u2013 whether that is a statue of a racist colonialist/national hero (delete according to your viewpoint), the films of Woody Allen and Roman Polanski, and, indeed, the men themselves, or novels, such as The Great Gatsby, that some students have said require trigger warnings. Despite what we so often read, art is neither one thing nor the other. While one viewer might look at Hylas and the Nymphs and see the young girls in it as \u201cmildly erotic\u201d, as this newspaper\u2019s art critic did, another viewer might remark a paedophilic tendency that is, actually, not at all mild or subtle. I might look at the almost-breasts of the young women \u2013 sorry, girls \u2013 in that painting and remember when my own looked like that, how young I was, how vulnerable, how books and trees and rollerskating promised infinitely more pleasure than the body of a powerful adult male. Would I ban Hylas and the Nymphs? Only on the grounds of cheesiness (this is a joke, do not write me emails). No, of course, I wouldn\u2019t ban it, just as I wouldn\u2019t ban filthy old pervert Degas and his pre-teen ballerinas. But I would like to see it as part of an exhibition that interrogates why so much of our artistic energy as a society has been devoted to sexually objectifying young girls. All of this brings to mind, inevitably, Lolita. In response to calls for censorship, Nabokov\u2019s acolytes have become furiously dogmatic about this novel and what it can be said to be about. I recall reading a New Yorker essay several years ago in which a male novelist examined his irritation at a statement that was made about the novel by his college professor. \u201cWhen you read Lolita, keep in mind that what you\u2019re reading about is the systematic rape of a young girl,\u201d the professor said. The novelist did not like this, but he was curious enough about why to do some self-examination. He talked to the feminist Alexandra Brodsky, who said: \u201cWhat a delight it must be to read a book full of graphic accounts of sexual violence and still have the book not be about sexual violence to you!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is the depersonalised, apolitical reading the one we should fight for?\u201d In other words, why is your reading (or indeed your way of seeing) the correct way? Your interpretation of a work of art, as for example, a white male, is profoundly influenced by who you are, and can in fact be said to be as political as any other. And yet: your viewing is apolitical, objective, fair, while mine, or, say, Olufemi\u2019s, is hysterical, shrieking, biased; a misinterpretation. Why? In Men Explain Lolita to Me, Rebecca Solnit responds wittily to the charge that, in identifying with Lolita, the young girl who is systematically raped over the course of the novel, Solnit has \u201cwilfully\u201d misunderstood Nabokov (there is such confidence in that statement, such conviction in the rightness of one\u2019s interpretation). But art is not one thing nor the other. Am I allowed to think that Lolita is a brilliant psychological study into the mind of a paedophile, but also wonder whether Nabokov, for whom paedophilia was something of a preoccupation and who may have been abused himself, got off on writing it?

Walken\u2019s disquieting, leonine screen presence and his unique voice are still compelling.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fa7fdf6a2ae34781e0b00549a7afe13b072b138\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fa7fdf6a2ae34781e0b00549a7afe13b072b138/37_46_2823_1694/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Pesci and Katherine Wallach in Goodfellas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Pesci and Katherine Wallach in Goodfellas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bros/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Funny, how? <strong>Joe Pesci</strong>\u2019s performance as the psychopathic wiseguy Tommy DeVito in Martin Scorsese\u2019s <strong>Goodfellas</strong> is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/19/goodfellas-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-joe-pesci-ray-liotta\">great supporting turns</a>: a performance that threatens to take over every scene he\u2019s in.

      "bodyText": "The best supporting actor Oscar often rewards the older performer, effectively saluting a lifetime\u2019s quietly accumulated savvy and technique, and sometimes even functioning as a kind of parallel lifetime achievement award: John Gielgud\u2019s Oscar for Arthur was a little like this. But it\u2019s also (as for Gielgud) an award for comedy: the funny, scene-stealing comic turn will often find itself with a statuette. Male Oscar-winners in this category are often the ones providing the pure flavour, and often amount to co-leads. And so, here are the nominations for best supporting actor \u2026 Walter Huston is a complete joy, playing the wise old prospector Howard in 1948\u2019s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, a parable of greed directed by his son, John. He is a fierce, wiry, funny presence in the film: a doer, a capable man of action, certainly compared with the liability that is Bogart\u2019s boozy, greedy, paranoid Fred C Dobbs. Huston ruled this movie with his initial analysis of gold economics, his miraculous cure for the unconscious boy, his speech about repairing the mountain \u2013 a rare moment of ecology in the Hollywood golden age. Wonderful stuff. With his drollery, suavity and immaculate dress sense, George Sanders cuts an elegant figure in Joseph Mankiewicz\u2019s black comedy All About Eve, from 1950. He is the cynical theatre critic Addison DeWitt, who is to play a malicious and cruel role in the supplanting of Bette Davis\u2019s ageing Broadway star by the cuckoo-in-the-nest young admirer, portrayed by Anne Baxter. He writes a column deliberately promoting the newcomer, at least partly to make trouble. Marilyn Monroe has a cameo as an actor, described by DeWitt as a \u201cgraduate of the Copacabana school of the dramatic arts\u201d. Michael Cimino\u2019s The Deer Hunter is a classic Vietnam movie, not least because it reminds you this was a war of conscription, unlike Afghanistan and Iraq. Christopher Walken plays Pennsylvania steelworker Nick Chevotarevich, sent to Vietnam with his friends, captured with others and forced to play a horrendous (if historically inauthentic) game of Russian roulette that is to change everyone\u2019s lives. Walken\u2019s disquieting, leonine screen presence and his unique voice are still compelling. Funny, how? Joe Pesci\u2019s performance as the psychopathic wiseguy Tommy DeVito in Martin Scorsese\u2019s Goodfellas is one of the great supporting turns: a performance that threatens to take over every scene he\u2019s in. He is violent, reckless, funny \u2013 especially in the famous speech in which he pulls the rug from under Ray Liotta\u2019s Henry Hill \u2013 and able to turn his mood on a dime from genial to malevolent. There is a grisly poignancy in his delivery of \u201cOh no\u2026!\u201d as he is ushered into an empty room for his fateful \u201cmade guy\u201d ceremony. Heath Ledger\u2019s sensational supporting role as the Joker in The Dark Knight was a compelling picture of pure, motiveless evil and chaos \u2013 still the best supervillain in superhero film history. His making the pencil \u201cdisappear\u201d is a stomach-turning exercise in wickedness and his whiteface makeup, always apparently disintegrating with sweat makes him look especially malign. \u2026 for his gloriously exuberant, intimidating performance, a nonstop firework display of gangster self-love and self-hate, aggressively bullying people while submissively bowing the knee to the mob\u2019s arbitrary and dysfunctional authority. Once seen, this performance can never be forgotten. The people\u2019s choice Peter has had his say on the greatest Oscar-winning supporting actor ever. Now it\u2019s time to find out who you, the people, have crowned your champion. We gave readers the chance to select their favourite from Peter\u2019s five nominees, and here\u2019s who they have chosen as their winner: Coming up next week ... Peter will be announcing the winners in the best actress category and the result of the readers\u2019 choice. Vote for your favourites below, and join us on Wednesday for the results.",

I got about halfway through the line \u201cBody like <em>wow</em>, pussy \u2019bout to end this drought\u201d in my best Julie Andrews voice, before reading the vibe of the room. As the waiter subtly cut me off from receiving any more coffee, I was left thinking it was everyone else\u2019s loss: now in its 10th season, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race is the best thing on TV.</p> <p>I\u2019m a straight cis man, and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race offers an insight into a world I know very little about \u2013 for me, the show is part entertainment and part education about an artform previously intended almost exclusively for the queer community. Watching Drag Race is a bit like watching Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics \u2013 at the start I don\u2019t know how any of it works, but by the end I feel qualified to make (completely uninformed) criticisms: \u201cShe has to stop relying on that body. Michelle has already told her she\u2019s resting on pretty \u2013 cut it out with the corset silhouette!\u201d</p> <p>Drag Race occupies a weird place in the zeitgeist \u2013 ostensibly countercultural, yet fast becoming one of the most celebrity-laden TV shows on the planet. This year\u2019s All Stars show has already featured High School Musical superstar Vanessa Hudgens (at one point performing in a lip sync battle against a pork chop), while last season\u2019s premiere starred Lady Gaga. It\u2019s a paradox reflected in the show itself, which is simultaneously the epitome of competitive reality TV and a pitch-perfect parody of it \u2013 RuPaul effectively does a Tyra Banks send-up every episode, with the over-the-top dramatic judgments and brilliantly terrible puns (\u201cImpersonating Beyonc\u00e9 is not your destiny, child\u201d). The result is strangely addictive. I have binge-watched almost every episode (save for the mythical \u201clost\u201d first season), and it\u2019s oddly disarming how you can find yourself invested in the stupidest challenges, be it attempting a Hello Kitty runway look to faking an orgasm in a Spanish <em>telenovela</em>.</p> <p>The show\u2019s success is spilling out into the rest of the world: RuPaul is finally gaining recognition from his peers, with two Emmy wins, multiple appearances on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show and cameos in Bojack Horseman and Broad City.

      "bodyText": "Is RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race mainstream? I had always assumed it was, because I like it, and I am an Incredibly Mainstream Man (I know most of Hamilton from memory and I won\u2019t eat a brand of crisps I haven\u2019t seen advertised on TV). But last week, as I was trying to explain the most recent episode of the Drag Race All Stars spin-off \u2013 specifically the part where BenDeLaCreme performed as Maria from the Sound of Music to the RuPaul track Call Me Mother \u2013 to a group of people who had never seen the show before, it occurred to me that I might be wrong. I got about halfway through the line \u201cBody like wow, pussy \u2019bout to end this drought\u201d in my best Julie Andrews voice, before reading the vibe of the room. As the waiter subtly cut me off from receiving any more coffee, I was left thinking it was everyone else\u2019s loss: now in its 10th season, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race is the best thing on TV. I\u2019m a straight cis man, and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race offers an insight into a world I know very little about \u2013 for me, the show is part entertainment and part education about an artform previously intended almost exclusively for the queer community. Watching Drag Race is a bit like watching Alpine skiing at the Winter Olympics \u2013 at the start I don\u2019t know how any of it works, but by the end I feel qualified to make (completely uninformed) criticisms: \u201cShe has to stop relying on that body. Michelle has already told her she\u2019s resting on pretty \u2013 cut it out with the corset silhouette!\u201d Drag Race occupies a weird place in the zeitgeist \u2013 ostensibly countercultural, yet fast becoming one of the most celebrity-laden TV shows on the planet. This year\u2019s All Stars show has already featured High School Musical superstar Vanessa Hudgens (at one point performing in a lip sync battle against a pork chop), while last season\u2019s premiere starred Lady Gaga. It\u2019s a paradox reflected in the show itself, which is simultaneously the epitome of competitive reality TV and a pitch-perfect parody of it \u2013 RuPaul effectively does a Tyra Banks send-up every episode, with the over-the-top dramatic judgments and brilliantly terrible puns (\u201cImpersonating Beyonc\u00e9 is not your destiny, child\u201d). The result is strangely addictive. I have binge-watched almost every episode (save for the mythical \u201clost\u201d first season), and it\u2019s oddly disarming how you can find yourself invested in the stupidest challenges, be it attempting a Hello Kitty runway look to faking an orgasm in a Spanish telenovela. The show\u2019s success is spilling out into the rest of the world: RuPaul is finally gaining recognition from his peers, with two Emmy wins, multiple appearances on Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show and cameos in Bojack Horseman and Broad City. Last year, Saturday Night Live referenced the show in a sketch, meaning that Americans now have a better sense of the lingo of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race than they do of how any British person talks (if Kate McKinnon\u2019s impression of Theresa May is anything to go by). The show is making waves closer to home as well: just last week, Celebrity Big Brother UK, contested by former MP Ann Widdecombe among others, was won by Drag Race alumnus Courtney Act. (The proof that drag queens get more votes than Tories may be something for Jeremy Corbyn to bear in mind ahead of the next election.) RuPaulisms pop up everywhere \u2013 my personal favourite was last year, when an anti-Trump protester carried a placard imploring the president to \u201csashay away\u201d. With his silky turn of phrase and quick wit, RuPaul would be the Mark Twain of our generation \u2013 if Mark Twain could work a runway and beat his face for filth. If anything, the show has become a victim of its own success. Arguably it is the only \u201cmainstream\u201d LGBTQ+ show currently on television, and yet represents a very small subsection. The trans community, in particular, has felt let down by the show: the transphobic 2014 challenge \u201cfemale or she-male\u201d was a low point.

      "body": "<p>Forty years ago, Mohammad Ali Chaudry, a Pakistani-born economist, made his home outside New York City. He came for an executive job at the telecoms company AT&amp;T, and ended up working there for decades. Like many immigrants to the US, Chaudry came to wholeheartedly believe \u2013 perhaps more fervently than his native-born neighbours \u2013 in the triumphal story that Americans tell about their nation: how it was always growing stronger through change, melding the many into one through the process of assimilation. Chaudry was a devout Muslim. But to him, it always seemed the things that made him different mattered less than the ways in which he had proved he was the same.</p> <p>Chaudry and his wife, who is from Italy, raised three children on a street called Manor Drive, in the town of Basking Ridge, in the centre of the state of New Jersey. This is not the \u201cJersey\u201d of popular imagination \u2013 the land of belching smokestacks immortalised in Bruce Springsteen\u2019s working-class anthems. Basking Ridge is out in horse country, an area of rolling green hills and white-steepled churches, not far from Bedminster, where Donald Trump has his summer estate. In keeping with the values of his adopted community, Chaudry became an active member of the local Republican party and a conspicuous civic presence, running for various elected boards. In 2004, at the height of George W Bush\u2019s war in Iraq, Chaudry became the first Pakistani-American to serve as mayor of a municipality in the US.</p> <p>Long after Chaudry retired from both AT&amp;T and electoral politics, he continued to keep a busy schedule of volunteer activities, most focused on building religious tolerance. He ran a small nonprofit organisation called the Center for Understanding Islam, and taught classes at local universities. Chaudry is bantam-sized, with a silvery moustache and a starchy manner, and despite his age \u2013 now 75 \u2013 he possesses a bottomless reservoir of diligent energy. He would travel the state, speaking to audiences young and old, always dressing the part of a politician, with a little American flag badge in his lapel. If there was prejudice around him in his adopted hometown, Chaudry later said that \u201cit was not obvious, or visible, or overt\u201d.</p> <p>That changed in 2011, when he found a new cause: building a mosque in Basking Ridge. For years, Chaudry and other local Muslims had been using a community centre for a makeshift Friday service. But Chaudry decided that the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge needed a permanent place to pray, and he located what he believed to be a suitable site: a four-acre lot occupied by a rundown Dutch Colonial house. Soon after purchasing it, Chaudry held an open house to greet the neighbours. \u201cThere was not too much tension,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of jovial.\u201d He put the letters \u201cISBR\u201d on the mailbox in front of the house, to announce the Islamic Society\u2019s arrival.</p> <p>Then someone smashed the mailbox. \u201cI was, of course, very surprised,\u201d Chaudry said. Under New Jersey\u2019s planning laws, the Islamic Society had to secure the approval of the municipal government to build the mosque, and from his experience as a public official, Chaudry knew that the town, which prided itself on its quaint homes and a history dating back to colonial times, was resistant to new development of any kind. But this was a house of worship, and he was someone well-known to the community. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I was expecting any favours,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cI expected them to be fair.\u201d What shocked him, though, was the hatred.</p> <p>That was seven long years ago, before some townspeople formed a group calling for \u201cresponsible development\u201d in furious opposition to the mosque, before the 39 planning board hearings, before the mosque was rejected, before Chaudry filed a lawsuit alleging religious prejudice, before his lawyers uncovered racially charged emails among officials opposed to his plan, before the Obama administration accused the town of civil rights violations, before national rightwing activists took notice of the dispute and began smearing Chaudry as a terrorist sympathiser, and before Trump dragged anti-Muslim conspiracy theories from the disreputable fringes into the White House. Today, Chaudry knows his town \u2013 and America \u2013 better.</p> <p>Long before Trump came along to capitalise on it, though, Islamophobia was building in the US, bubbling up like swamp gas from the depths. Often, racial conflict would manifest itself in small, seemingly isolated local planning fights over proposals to build mosques. The US Department of Justice, which staunchly defended the rights of Muslims during the Obama administration, noted a sharp increase in such mosque disputes between 2010 and 2016. Many took place in conservative locales such as rural Murfreesboro, Tennessee. But they also broke out in unexpected places such as Basking Ridge: a wealthy and well-educated community in the outwardly tolerant north-eastern US.</p> <p>Basking Ridge is governed by a five-person elected committee, which meets in a repurposed Tudor-style mansion. (It previously belonged to John Jacob Astor VI, an American aristocrat whose father perished on the Titanic.) One evening last year, I attended a meeting \u2013 the first of many \u2013 at the town hall, where the committee members sat on a long dais, discussing their usual business, such as preparations for an upcoming celebration of the signing of Basking Ridge\u2019s royal charter, in 1760. When the meeting was opened to comments from the public, however, all anyone wanted to talk about was Chaudry and the mosque.</p> <p>\u201cThe neighbours near this proposed mosque did not sign up to live next to this house of worship,\u201d said one resident, who broke down sobbing as she spoke. \u201cThey have been members of a quiet residential neighbourhood for decades, and do not look forward to having their routines and lives disrupted.\u201d</p> <p>The residents said the mosque would create traffic and commotion, and would ruin their property values. But they also complained about the tactics Chaudry had employed in his bitter court battle. One middle-aged woman gestured toward the mosque opponents in the audience, saying that many had been subjected to \u201ca hateful harassment campaign\u201d by the Islamic Society\u2019s attorneys, who had served them with subpoenas seeking the contents of their personal email and social media accounts, in an effort to prove that they were motivated not by planning concerns, but animosity toward Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cMr Chaudry has waged an expensive PR campaign that has talked about people as if they\u2019re bigots,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd personally, I think it is the ISBR group that has been bullying and bigoted.\u201d Then she invoked Trump, the inescapable presence. \u201cThey talk about our current president and how he speaks about Muslims. Well, I find ISBR\u2019s rhetoric to be just as harmful.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, Loretta Quick, a schoolteacher who lived next door to the mosque site, got up to speak. She was one of the neighbours who had come to Chaudry\u2019s initial open house years before. She had even voted for him, back when he was a politician. Now she was a die-hard enemy of the mosque. \u201cIf you cave,\u201d she told the board, in a furious voice, \u201cyou\u2019re saying that we are bigots, that we based the decision on discrimination against Islam.\u201d</p> <p>Quick was one of those who had been served with a subpoena, and was being represented by the Thomas More Law Center, an advocacy group that claims its mission is to defend \u201cAmerica\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and moral values\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thomasmore.org/key_issue/confronting-the-threat-islam/\">against forces waging a \u201cStealth Jihad\u201d</a> to \u201ctransform America into an Islamic nation\u201d. Quick referenced <a href=\"https://www.thomasmore.org/news/islamic-society-questionable-background-joins-forces-justice-department-intimidate-citizens-opposing-mosque/\">a recent press release</a> the Law Center had put out, which had plucked a few verses from a searchable English translation of the Qur\u2019an that could be accessed on the ISBR website \u2013 \u201cFight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them\u201d, etc \u2013 to suggest that Chaudry was somehow in league with religious extremists.</p> <p>\u201cThese are words that seem quite intimidating and threatening to me,\u201d Quick said. \u201cI want to be protected, and you owe that to me, this township and this nation.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>How did a small-town property dispute turn into a religious war, with legal and symbolic implications for all of America? Part of the answer has to do with the country\u2019s labyrinthine land-use laws, which leave most control to state and local governments, which are in turn vulnerable to the furies of angry mobs. Part of it has to do with America\u2019s love of litigation. The inherently confrontational and intrusive legal process had a radicalising effect on the town, driving some opponents of the development to extremes.</p> <p>But something else deeper and darker seemed to be at work. Some residents openly discussed Islamophobic conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the mosque was meant to send a message of conquest, due to its proximity to the town\u2019s September 11 memorial. Such crackpot notions, promoted by far-right ideologues such as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pamela-geller-american-patriot-or-extremist-firebrand-2282486.html\">Pamela Geller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-frank-gaffney-national-security-advisor-beliefs-conspiracy-theorist-islamophobia-a7420241.html\">Frank Gaffney</a>, used to be confined to the margins of the internet. Then Trump embraced the Islamophobes, unabashedly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like his election has given permission to people,\u201d Chaudry told me the first time we met. We were at the proposed site of the mosque, sitting in the old suburban house that he was still hoping to demolish. Its living room, dominated by a large stone fireplace, was filled with boxes of donated clothes that he was preparing to deliver to a family of Syrian refugees. The many bookshelves were lined with theological texts and stacked copies of a paperback that Chaudry likes to give out, <a href=\"http://www.islamdenouncesterrorism.com/\">Islam Denounces Terrorism</a>. Standing on an easel in a corner was a poster-sized rendering of the proposed mosque. In an effort to make it fit into its suburban surroundings, it had been designed to resemble a mini-mansion, with gray clapboard siding, a pitched roof with asphalt shingles, dormer windows and minarets disguised as chimneys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68c9b60d9f7ba04193ff76e160a2af50976ff5ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68c9b60d9f7ba04193ff76e160a2af50976ff5ed/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaudry in his home office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammad Ali Chaudry, the founder and president of the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, in his home office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred R Conrad for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the architecture did little to defuse tensions with the surrounding neighbourhood. Liberty Corner considered itself separate from the older and wealthier village of Basking Ridge, though they were both part of the same larger township, and few outsiders recognised the geographical distinction. And as even Chaudry and his allies admitted, some of the locals had a stubborn and ecumenical commitment to protesting anyone who dared to build anything, including Christian churches. People in Liberty Corner expressed an obstreperous ideology often abbreviated as \u201cnimby\u201d, for \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d.</p> <p>The opponents of the mosque told their own story of victimisation, in which they were merely objecting to Chaudry\u2019s oppressive development scheme. \u201cIt was always about land use,\u201d one Liberty Corner resident told me. \u201c<em>They</em> made it about religion.\u201d The nimby complainers claimed that the mosque site \u2013 a marshy plot on a mainly residential street \u2013 was a poor location for a busy house of prayer. When the township planning board took up Chaudry\u2019s proposal in August 2012, signs soon appeared in front yards around town, reading \u201cPreserve Liberty Corner\u201d.</p> <p>At one of the first planning hearings, a resident named Lori Caratzola stood up to challenge Chaudry. A law graduate, she cross-examined him about the size of the Islamic Society, accusing him of understating its membership. She revealed that she had done surveillance of a Friday service, counting 125 worshippers going into a space with a capacity for 60. After her confrontational performance, Caratzola became a leader of the opposition.</p> <p>At the public hearings, Caratzola and others confined their criticisms to the nimby issues: drainage, parking, landscaping and the like. They convinced the board that a mosque would need more parking spaces than a church, because midday worshippers would come alone. When the Islamic Society submitted a new plan, with a larger parking lot, the mosque\u2019s opponents protested that, too. It quickly became clear that the opposition was not solely concerned with parking.</p> <p>Around the time the hearings began, some residents received an anonymous piece of mail. Inside was a letter entitled \u201cMeet Your New Neighbor\u201d, and a CD containing a recording of a radio interview in which Chaudry had offered some mildly nuanced opinions on Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah. \u201cHere in Basking Ridge, on the surface, we see the serene, grinning academic Ali Chaudry, always willing to help us better understand the version of Islam he wants us to know,\u201d the letter read. \u201cScratch the surface a little and an uglier picture emerges.\u201d</p> <p>The author of the letter tenuously linked Chaudry to the Muslim Brotherhood and the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theawl.com/2015/10/the-sad-true-story-of-the-ground-zero-mosque/\">Ground Zero mosque</a>\u201d \u2013 a proposed Islamic community centre in Lower Manhattan that Pamela Geller and Fox News had recently whipped up into a national controversy. It cited the term <em>taqiyya</em>, an obscure theological concept that Islamophobes often twist to suggest that Muslims are encouraged to lie about the true nature of their violent beliefs.</p> <p>\u201cSo, welcome to the neighbourhood, Ali,\u201d the letter concluded. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Ali about those Koranic verses regarding Jews and Christians in your Koran. Why are so many terroristic acts propagated by Muslims? Is it something they are taught in your mosques and at home? And what will <em>you</em> teach in your new Liberty Corner mosque? You wouldn\u2019t lie to us, would you? <em>Taqiyya</em> is wrong, right?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Just as the author of the letter accused Muslims of deception, the Islamic Society, in its lawsuit, alleged that many of the neighbours were presenting a false front, using preservationist sentiment to disguise their real, less respectable fears. \u201cThe key thing to remember,\u201d said Adeel Mangi, an attorney for the Islamic Society, \u201cis that these complaints are commonly used as a smokescreen.\u201d</p> <p>There is, literally, an anti-mosque playbook. Tactics were once unwritten, spread through websites and word of mouth, but more recently they were set down in a book titled <a href=\"https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2016/12/15/mosques-in-america-a-guide-to-accountable-permit-hearings-and-continuing-citizen-oversight/\">Mosques in America: A Guide to Accountable Permit Hearings and Continuing Citizen Oversight</a>. Written a Texas attorney, it was published by the Center for Security Policy, an organisation headed by Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan administration official who has long espoused the theory that Muslims are engaged in a secret plot to impose sharia law on the US. Gaffney writes in the book\u2019s introduction that it is a \u201chow-to manual for patriotic Americans who are ready to counter the leading edge of Islamic supremacism\u201d.</p> <p>The manual offers lessons from cases like the one in Basking Ridge. \u201cIt may be startling to consider, but Islamists are entitled to exploit liberal free speech rights to advance their political and legal operations,\u201d the author warns. It advises residents to express objections in the manner most likely to sway the authorities, avoiding mention of religious issues. \u201cConcerned citizens must learn to express questions and reservations in a manner appropriate to the relevant civic forum\u2019s purpose,\u201d the manual says, instructing readers that \u201crather than expressing alarm as hysteria, speaking to local government officials and media requires a strategic response based on reason, facts, precedents, and the law\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a0258e6d542e5e5aa070928b572a4d2c9769d4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a0258e6d542e5e5aa070928b572a4d2c9769d4d/0_0_5565_3339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad Ali Chaudry, the founder and president of the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge, preparing the Bernards Township community centre for Friday prayers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaudry preparing the Bernards Township community centre for Friday prayers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred R Conrad for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sure enough, the transcripts of the dozens of hearings held by the town\u2019s planning board, which run to nearly 7,000 pages, contain no mention of sharia, the Muslim Brotherhood or other rightwing hobgoblins. Most residents swore that religion had nothing to do with their opposition. But the Islamic society\u2019s lawyers suspected \u2013 and would later allege in court \u2013 that their opponents were showing another face when they talked to each other on the internet. A commenter named \u201cLC\u201d \u2013 who appeared to be Caratzola \u2013 often expressed anti-Muslim sentiments when the mosque was debated on local web forums and national sites with names such as Bare Naked Islam. (Motto: \u201cIt isn\u2019t Islamophobia when they really ARE trying to kill you.\u201d) Caratzola was also listed as a member of a Gaffney-affiliated group set up to defend against the supposedly creeping influence of sharia on US courts. (\u201cI stand by that,\u201d Caratzola later told the New York Times, claiming that \u201cevery single terrorist attack in the last 20 years was committed by Muslims\u201d.)</p> <p>In December 2015, a few days after a Muslim husband and wife killed 14 people in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/02/san-bernardino-california-shooting\">terrorist attack in San Bernardino</a>, California, and shortly before candidate Donald Trump proposed a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/?utm_term=.92d467374828\">\u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d</a> of Muslim immigration, the town\u2019s planning board voted to reject the mosque.</p> <p>At Caratzola\u2019s urging, the town government also adopted a new ordinance that raised the minimum size of the plot required to build any new house of worship \u2013 which would effectively prevent the Islamic Society from building on its own site in the future. The Islamic Society quickly filed a lawsuit against the township, alleging the opposition was a \u201cwell-funded machine\u201d that was \u201csubstantially grounded in anti-Muslim animus\u201d.</p> <p>The lawsuit particularly highlighted Caratzola\u2019s role as a ringleader of the opposition. In a letter to a local newspaper, she accused the Islamic Society of \u201cslander\u201d \u2013 and invoked the concept of <em>taqiyya</em> to suggest that Chaudry\u2019s mosque proposal was not what it seemed. \u201cMany people and groups in the Muslim community,\u201d she wrote, \u201care trying to quash what we so fervently cherish in America \u2013 the freedom of speech.\u201d</p> <p>The Islamic Society also claimed it had the constitution on its side \u2013 specifically, the first-amendment protection of the freedoms of religion and assembly. And Chaudry could call upon a powerful ally: Barack Obama. Under his administration, the Justice Department intervened on behalf of Muslims in many mosque disputes, including a highly publicised case in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where the construction of a mosque was opposed with lawsuits, protests and an arson attack. It was able to rely on a powerful legal tool: a law, originally passed with bipartisan support in 2000, that specifically bans local governments from discriminating against religious organisations when it comes to land use.</p> <p>The enforcement policy \u201creflected the fact that Islamophobia is a real problem across America\u201d, said Tom Perez, who handled the Murfreesboro case as a director of the Civil Rights Division. (He is currently chairman of the Democratic National Committee.) \u201cI think as you see the proliferation of social media, the world has gotten smaller,\u201d Perez told me. \u201cPeople who harbour these extreme views have a virtual platform to spread their hate.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, the US Justice Department filed its own lawsuit, claiming that the local planning board violated the Islamic Society\u2019s rights in rejecting its building plan. To Islamophobic activists, who spent the eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency promoting conspiracy theories about his birth certificate and suggesting he was secretly a Muslim, such moves were yet more evidence of the administration\u2019s suspiciously sympathetic stance toward Islam. \u201cIslamic supremacists and Muslim Brotherhood organisations \u2026 called upon their running dogs at the Department of Justice to impose the sharia and usurp American law for Islamic law,\u201d Pam Geller wrote in a blogpost about the Basking Ridge mosque case. \u201cWhat small town can go up against the US government\u2019s vast resources and endless taxpayer-funded muscle?\u201d</p> <p>The federal government\u2019s intervention had a radicalising effect in Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood\u2019s enemy was no longer a pushy former mayor; it was President Obama. Then, as if a Justice Department investigation wasn\u2019t intrusive enough, private citizens started receiving knocks on their doors from people carrying subpoenas, seeking to probe their email and social media accounts. The Islamic Society\u2019s lawyers \u2013 members of a prestigious Manhattan firm that was working pro-bono \u2013 wanted to prove that Caratzola was really the commenter \u201cLC\u201d, and that she and her allies were communicating their true attitudes to each other \u2013 and to their elected leaders \u2013 outside of the public meetings. </p> <p>Understandably, though, the private citizens felt threatened by the intrusion. Their complaints attracted the attention of the Thomas More Law Center, which intervened on the behalf of residents seeking to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the demand would have a chilling effect on free speech. On its website, the Law Center decried the \u201coutrageous unconstitutional intimidation\u201d, alongside a heroic photo of Caratzola standing in front of an American flag. \u201cLori Caratzola,\u201d the caption read. \u201cPersecuted for opposing the mosque.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On 31 December 2016, a federal judge issued a preliminary decision in the Basking Ridge case, finding that the planning board had exercised \u201cunbridled and unconstitutional discretion\u201d in requiring the mosque to have more parking than other houses of worship. Though the case was far from over, it was clear that the law favoured Chaudry. The victory rang hollow, though. Trump had just been elected president, giving a jarring rebuke to liberal values, and placing Muslim-Americans like Chaudry in a newly precarious position.</p> <p>As a candidate, to bolster his call for a ban on Muslim immigration, Trump had often cited the research from the Center for Security Policy, Gaffney\u2019s group. (\u201cVery highly respected people, who I know, actually.\u201d) Some of his most important advisers, such as Steve Bannon and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38029336\">Mike Pompeo</a>, soon to be named the CIA director, were outspoken Gaffney admirers. Gaffney saluted the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions \u2013 the 2015 winner of the Center for Security Policy\u2019s \u201cKeeper of the Flame\u201d award \u2013 for his vigilance \u201cagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d. With Sessions and other members of the nativist right in charge of the federal government, the Justice Department\u2019s commitment toward protecting Muslims and their mosques looked shaky.</p> <p>On a chilly Friday in April last year, still early in Trump\u2019s presidency, I helped Chaudry as he performed his weekly ritual, carrying items from the garage of the old house in Liberty Corner to his gold Toyota SUV. In went eight rolled-up prayer rugs, then the plastic donation boxes, the folding music stand that serves as a lectern, the sound system, the digital clock, which was synchronised with Mecca, and four decorative mats, which Chaudry uses to slightly sanctify the drab walls of the community centre that the Islamic Society currently uses for its Jummah service. When the SUV, known as the \u201cMosque Mobile\u201d, was full, Chaudry would drive it across town for prayers. \u201cI\u2019m just overwhelmed with everything that is going on,\u201d he said as we got in the car. For the past few months, Trump had been fighting to impose his ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, sparking court confrontations and massive protests.</p> <p>Chaudry was responding to the crisis with a characteristic burst of civic activity, participating in political forums and interfaith vigils. The relationship between Muslim communities and their government was wary at the best of times, and Trump was making it much worse, but Chaudry saw himself as a trust-building emissary. He served on advisory panels to law enforcement. A few weeks before, he\u2019d spoken about discrimination and the travel ban at a worried meeting between Muslim leaders and many prominent New Jersey politicians. At the forum, as he did nearly everywhere he went, Chaudry promoted an earnest personal cause, asking everyone present to take a formal pledge he\u2019d composed, to \u201cStand up for the Other\u201d.</p> <p>The Mosque Mobile turned on to Church Street, the main road through Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood traced its name back to the American revolution, and the whole town took great patriotic pride in the role it had played in the independence struggle, as a stronghold for George Washington\u2019s army. Chaudry took a roundabout route, pointing out horse farms and new tract developments, and a park where the Islamic Society prayed when the community centre was used for a summer camp. \u201cWhere the flag is, this is the 9/11 memorial,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cI was on the township committee when we did that. Eighteen people here died.\u201d A wooded road took us into Basking Ridge. In the yard of its Presbyterian church, founded in 1717, stood an ancient tree known as the \u201cHoly Oak\u201d, where Washington is said to have picnicked with the Marquis de Lafayette.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"23ec2d5fb425f4b19274d43a317ab6cb22caf9f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23ec2d5fb425f4b19274d43a317ab6cb22caf9f2/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Liberty Corner Presbyterian church, a few blocks away from the proposed Islamic Center of Basking Ridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liberty Corner Presbyterian church, a few blocks away from the proposed Islamic Center of Basking Ridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred R.

We rolled out the mats and set up the speakers, and used a 30-metre (100-ft) sound cable to connect the small main room with an adjacent annex, which was used for overflow. Chaudry pointed, proudly, to his name on a plaque on the wall \u2013 he had helped to establish the centre. About a decade before, he and around a dozen other Muslims had started gathering there. But there were more Muslims around than he realised, working as doctors in the area\u2019s hospitals, or as scientists in its many pharmaceutical firms, or as engineers at a big telecommunications company. The Islamic Society had long ago outgrown its temporary space.</p> <p>The worshippers began to arrive, most of them men coming from office jobs, plastic ID badges hanging from their belts. They dropped their shoes in an unruly pile near the centre\u2019s doorway, and used a cramped galley kitchen to perform <em>wudu</em>, the Muslim washing ritual. Then they knelt down as the muezzin sang a call to prayer.</p> <p>Because it lacked a permanent home, the Islamic Society had no imam, and it relied on a rotating cast to lead services. This week\u2019s visitor, Chaudry told me, was known as \u201cthe crying imam\u201d. That week, dozens of Syrian civilians, including many children, had been killed in a poison gas attack, and the night before, Trump had fired cruise missiles in reprisal. The imam, dressed in a long black robe, led a prayer for \u201cour brothers and sisters in Syria\u201d. His voice trembling, he sobbed, \u201cGive peace to this region.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one of his characteristics,\u201d Chaudry said after the service. \u201cHe does become emotional.\u201d Most of the worshippers, who numbered around 70 in all, quickly returned to their cars and hurried back to work. Chaudry repacked the Mosque Mobile.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been carrying these rugs for more than 10 years now, and I\u2019m tired of doing it,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to have a place of our own.\u201d</p> <p>As we drove out of Basking Ridge, Chaudry pointed out the Holy Oak, standing tall in the churchyard. The tree was rotten, he told me. Later that month, it would be cut down, and its dead branches handed out to townspeople as patriotic keepsakes.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Despite Trump\u2019s election, Chaudry still retained his hope for justice, at least for his congregation. The case was now in the courts, which meant the Justice Department couldn\u2019t easily abandon it. The town\u2019s government, facing an almost certain legal defeat, was under pressure from its insurance company to settle its lawsuit with the Islamic Society quickly, before a trial.</p> <p>Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, negotiations dragged on over a settlement, which would include a large damages payment to the Islamic Society. I attended endless meetings of the township\u2019s elected committee, at which angry citizens would demand information from stone-faced board members, inveighing against the settlement in increasingly apocalyptic terms. Chaudry attended with other members of the Islamic Society. He sat in the front row but said nothing, keeping his head down and scribbling in a pad, showing no emotion even in the face of incendiary provocations.</p> <p>The opponents were a surprisingly diverse lot. There were some old-money Protestants, who complained that the hubbub would bother their horses. But some of the most emotional speakers were new residents, many of them immigrants from south and east Asia. At one meeting, one of the Islamic Society\u2019s closest neighbours, a medical professional from India who was building a large house directly behind the mosque plot, stood up and addressed the Muslims in the audience directly.</p> <p>\u201cIf you are somehow able to get a mosque built, you will create a divide which you will not be able to bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, if the site would move to another appropriate location, you will earn our respect, and you will truly earn the right to build a mosque in this town. What is it that you want, to just build a mosque, or set an example for the whole country?\u201d</p> <p>By the perverse logic of the mosque opponents, it was the Islamic Society that had brought discrimination upon itself, by suing over discrimination. There was only one thing the Muslims could do to prove themselves worthy neighbours: go somewhere else.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t be fair to say, though, that everyone who spoke against the mosque was religiously motivated. Many, if not most, of the adversaries appeared to be genuinely impassioned in their opposition to development in Liberty Corner. \u201cSure, there\u2019s a 5% lunatic fringe,\u201d Paul Zubulake told me one evening while sitting on a bench outside the town hall, waiting for yet another meeting to begin. But he said that for him, and many others, religion was beside the point: \u201cIt\u2019s about our quality of life. It\u2019s going to destroy our community.\u201d</p> <p>To show me what he loved about Liberty Corner, Zubalake invited me to visit his home, a few doors down from the Islamic Society property. When I arrived, on a rainy Memorial Day in late May, a soggy town parade was making its way down the main thoroughfare, Church Street. As Zubulake was introducing me to his family \u2013 explaining that his son has autism, and they had moved to the area for his schooling \u2013 he spotted the mayor marching by with other members of the township committee. He dashed down to the roadside and shouted: \u201cThere\u2019s still time!\u201d</p> <p>The politicians frowned and kept marching down Church Street. \u201cI just want them to know how pissed off I am,\u201d Zubulake said.</p> <p>Chaudry, meanwhile, had organised a contingent from the Islamic Society to march in the Memorial Day parade. They met in front of the house, next to a sign that Chaudry had staked in the yard, reading: \u201cProud to Be An American.\u201d Whether by chance or intention, the parade\u2019s organisers had put the Islamic Society at the very rear, right behind another marginalised group, the local Democrats. Chaudry coaxed the children who were marching with the Islamic Society\u2019s banner to stay in a tight formation. \u201cGood morning!\u201d he called from beneath a big black umbrella, waving an American flag with his free hand. The parade route ended at a war memorial, where Chaudry left a wreath with a mosque insignia.</p> <p>\u201cMy advice to the community has always been that this is not the time to hide,\u201d Chaudry told me later. \u201cYou have to be out there, fighting for your rights.\u201d</p> <p>To some people in Basking Ridge, Chaudry\u2019s struggle looked less noble. They saw his battle with the town government as a local political feud, which dated back to his tenure as an elected official, long before he ever proposed the mosque. Chaudry had first run for a seat on the town committee in 2001. After September 11, which hit the commuter town hard, he told the local newspaper: \u201cWe are all under attack.\u201d But a Republican party leader called him to suggest it might be better if his campaign signs, which read \u201cAli Chaudry\u201d, just used his last name. \u201cI said everyone knows who I am,\u201d Chaudry told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never kept it a secret.\u201d He won the election. But he was not universally popular.</p> <p>The way the local government worked, the office of mayor rotated annually among the elected members of the township committee. In 2004, it was Chaudry\u2019s turn. As the US\u2019s first Pakistani-American mayor, he made a triumphant visit to his homeland, where he met with the foreign minister, and gave interviews in which he hinted that he had ambitions for higher office. But local critics found him arrogant and high-handed. The next time he was up for election, he held on to his committee seat by just 11 votes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d6b99198eeb6dbb014d368cbb36e3950283f1210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6b99198eeb6dbb014d368cbb36e3950283f1210/0_195_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chaudry speaking during Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaudry speaking during Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred R Conrad for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The local Republican party was also in the midst of a schism, and Chaudry and his allies were ultimately driven out by a more conservative faction, which ran on the slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Take Your Town Back.\u201d The bad blood spilled over into the mosque dispute. The most damning evidence produced by the Islamic Society in the course of its lawsuit came from the correspondence of the town\u2019s elected officials, many of whom had formerly served and clashed with Chaudry. They expressed their hostility in raw, racially offensive terms.</p> <p>A town committee member named John Malay compared Chaudry to a stereotypically shifty native character in the 1930s film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. \u201cWe [finally] ousted him, whereupon he went to Mecca, got a funny hat and declared himself the imam of a new mosque here in town,\u201d Malay wrote. \u201cReligion trumps even politics as a refuge for scoundrels, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>Other emails contained jokes about Muslims, pigs and Barack Obama. \u201cMan child,\u201d John Carpenter, another committee member, wrote of Obama. \u201cThe product of fools, raised by idiots and coddled by affirmative action. Behold the beast.\u201d The emails revealed that Carpenter had even lobbied to prevent Chaudry from participating in a September 11 commemoration ceremony, alleging he was an extremist. \u201c[Find] a real moderate Muslim,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere must be one. We shouldn\u2019t look the other way on his views \u2013 we owe that to our dead residents. Let\u2019s make it happen without that fool.\u201d When the correspondence came out in court filings, Carpenter offered no apologies. \u201cYou should not confuse contempt with bigotry,\u201d he told a newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to not like the guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a funny guy with this identity thing,\u201d Carpenter told me when we met for coffee at a diner over the summer. \u201cHe was known as, quote, \u2018Mr Muslim\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Carpenter, a tall, balding salesman, had served on the town committee for more than a decade, and was running for re-election. He was outraged that his unguarded words had been used to portray him \u2013 and the entire township \u2013 as racist. \u201cWhen government tries to see into someone\u2019s heart, that\u2019s when we fall into totalitarianism,\u201d he told me.</p> <p>He advanced a conspiratorial theory, which I heard from other mosque opponents, that Chaudry had been \u201cengineering failure\u201d all along, so that he could sue and win millions in damages, as other mosques had done. He said he believed that Chaudry and the Obama administration had been conspiring. A Justice Department official involved in the investigation of the township, he noted, served with Chaudry on the board of a local university\u2019s Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict. (Chaudry says they never discussed the case.)</p> <p>\u201cI find it ironic that he served on this council for religious conflict, and what he really was trying to do here \u2013 and I don\u2019t think he succeeded in the end, because people see through it \u2013 is create a religious conflict,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI don\u2019t think what happened is fair to the people of the town, and I think it\u2019s important for other people around the country to know what\u2019s coming their way.\u201d</p> <p>Carpenter said he had been hopeful that Trump\u2019s election would bring \u201ca little sanity to the Department of Justice\u201d, and a reversal of its stance on the mosque case, but so far, he had been disappointed. He knew the president was spending his summer vacation at his private club in Bedminster, though, just a quick drive away from Basking Ridge. \u201cHe\u2019s there for three weeks,\u201d joked Carpenter, an avid cyclist. \u201cMaybe I could sneak in, ride my bike up the back road: I need to speak to the president!\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>All year long, as I kept returning to see Chaudry, Donald Trump loomed over our conversation. One Saturday morning in September, on my way to meet Chaudry at a Lutheran Church\u2019s symposium on \u201cRace, Hatred and Bigotry\u201d, I looked up in the sky and saw the presidential helicopter heading toward Bedminster. Trump\u2019s embrace of the worst in politics \u2013 fanning terrorism hysteria, retweeting racist memes, refusing to condemn the white nationalist demonstrators in Charlottesville \u2013 had real consequences on the ground. \u201cPeople are emboldened to come out and say things that they never felt they could say before,\u201d Chaudry told the symposium. \u201cThey have a licence, because the person in the highest office of the country is engaging in that kind of language.\u201dAt one point, the room suddenly filled with a disconcerting roar from low-flying military jets.</p> <p>Chaudry introduced a pair of high school girls, one of whom was wearing hijab, who eloquently described their experiences with bullying confrontations on the school bus and social media platforms. \u201cI would say to my non-Muslim friends: this is the Muslim community,\u201d Chaudry said when they finished their presentation.</p> <p>As the controversy over the mosque moved toward a settlement, the town committee held a series of heated public hearings. Many members of the Islamic Society attended, to show a human face to their neighbours. They always took care to present themselves as model citizens: upscale professionals, and the parents of striving children.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not some strange boogeyman that came out of nowhere,\u201d Yasmine Khalil told me. She was a doctor and a vocal mosque supporter, who had moved to the township from Manhattan a few years before. Khalil said she had been dismayed to see the ugliness infiltrate even a private Facebook group for local mothers, where she had got into commenting wars about Islam. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t just quiet and silent and in the background,\u201d she said, \u201cthey took it upon themselves to kick me out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47eb2be00da5bc6634386887235a5ecf8427428f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47eb2be00da5bc6634386887235a5ecf8427428f/0_507_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chaudry holding his copy of the Qur\u2019an.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chaudry holding his copy of the Qur\u2019an.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred R Conrad for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At one public meeting, a white-haired man \u2013 one of the crustier opposing voices \u2013 tripped and fell, and Khalil rushed across the room, thinking he might need medical assistance. He was fine, and the meeting went on. Khalil gave a speech, introducing herself as a mother. \u201cWe are your friends, we are your neighbours \u2013 I could be your doctor,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cI want my kids to feel like they\u2019re welcomed. I want my kids to feel proud of the people that we have chosen to surround them with.\u201d</p> <p>The old man she had just rushed to help piped up: \u201cMove to an appropriate place!\u201d</p> <p>Chaudry said non-Muslims in Basking Ridge would often pull him aside, to quietly confide that they were ashamed about what was happening to the town. He hoped that, at some point, the forces of conciliation would make themselves heard. Instead, the tenor of the debate only grew more hysterical. It reached its climax when a particularly vociferous mosque opponent named Nick Xu, a Chinese-American volunteer for Trump\u2019s campaign, gave a speech claiming that the Islamic Society\u2019s lawsuit was part of a \u201csystematic plot\u201d to wage war through the courts. \u201cIf you google \u2018Islamic Lawfare\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see dozens, dozens of these kind of lawsuits.\u201d In response to Xu, a man named James Rickey \u2013 a member of one of the town\u2019s old Scots-Irish families \u2013 came to his feet, full of righteous contempt. \u201cThe tone that has been used here tonight is disgraceful,\u201d Rickey said. \u201cWe\u2019re all human beings. We should respect each other.\u201d</p> <p>With that, and without debate, the town committee grimly voted to approve the settlement, agreeing to reverse the planning board\u2019s rejection while paying the Islamic Society $3.5m. John Carpenter was the lone dissenter. The townspeople again raised a loud clamour. \u201cWe understand your frustration,\u201d the mayor told them. \u201cBut this is what we are required to do by federal law.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks later, the Islamic Society celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan beneath a white tent set up next to a practice green at the Basking Ridge Country Club. Chaudry addressed the service while standing next to a poster-sized rendering of the mosque. \u201cAs many of you know,\u201d he said, \u201cwe now have \u2013 alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah \u2013 a settlement with the township, which calls for us to submit a revised plan, and I am honoured to tell you that at 4.49pm yesterday I received from our engineers the plan that we intend to submit tomorrow, inshallah. Many people thought this was impossible. As Nelson Mandela said once, things seem impossible until they are done.\u201d</p> <p>For the holiday, Chaudry had secured the services of a guest imam who spoke of the \u201cconstant shockwave\u201d that Trump\u2019s election had sent through the Muslim community in America. When the prayers were finished, Chaudry stood at the front of the tent and accepted congratulations from members of his congregation. \u201cPeople said, why are we doing this here, where people don\u2019t like us?\u201d he told one. \u201cI say, where can you go where people like you?\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>It is not yet clear what the Trump presidency will mean for the Justice Department\u2019s policy on mosque disputes. Eric Rassbach, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, told me that so far the department \u201cseems to be staying the course\u201d. Still, ideological shifts take time to assert themselves within government bureaucracies, and Tom Perez said there is \u201cevery reason to be concerned\u201d about the Justice Department\u2019s direction. \u201cDonald Trump certainly adds gas to the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will bring additional pressure to bear on the DOJ to do the wrong thing.\u201d</p> <p>Chaudry no longer considered himself a Republican, for obvious reasons, but he was still guarded in his criticism of Trump. All summer, while the president vacationed nearby, a few self-proclaimed members of the resistance would protest on a street corner in Bedminster. Chaudry never participated. Instead, he organised interfaith prayer services, and tried to be a moderating force. When an alleged Islamic State supporter from New Jersey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/oct/31/new-york-vehicle-manhattan-bike-path-attack-fears-live-updates\">killed eight people with a truck</a> on a Manhattan bike path in October, Chaudry hastened to arrange a reassuring visit of police officials to a mosque near the suspect\u2019s home, which was receiving death threats. Meanwhile, every time Trump tweeted something horrible about Muslims, Chaudry would wearily draw up a public statement. \u201cWith him, you can never tell what he\u2019s going to say,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Under the terms of the Islamic Society\u2019s settlement, the mosque was granted a rehearing before the planning board in August, at which \u201cno commentary regarding Islam or Muslims\u201d was to be considered. The procedure was a mere formality, and the mosque was approved. Lori Caratzola, who recently moved out of Basking Ridge, was not present for the vote. She did not respond to interview requests; neither did the Thomas More Law Center, the rightwing group that came to her aid in the Islamic Society\u2019s lawsuit. With the federal case concluded, the issue of the subpoenas to private citizens is now moot. But the Thomas More Law Center has continued to file lawsuits on the behalf of other mosque opponents, including neighbour Loretta Quick, claiming that their elected representatives had \u201ccolluded with ISBR\u2019s \u2018Civilization Jihad\u2019\u201d. Another lawsuit, brought by a former member of the planning board, is challenging the mosque\u2019s approval on procedural grounds.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s far from over,\u201d Zubulake told me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting it to the bitter end.\u201d</p> <p>While continuing to fight on the legal front, Chaudry is now raising funds \u2013 much of the settlement went to pay his lawyers, who are in turn donating the money to charity \u2013 while also going through the permitting process. He hopes to demolish the house soon, so he can hold a groundbreaking ceremony some time in 2018. One person who won\u2019t be attending is the current town mayor, John Carpenter. He promptly appointed Nick Xu \u2013 the \u201cIslamic lawfare\u201d guy \u2013 to a pair of township boards.</p> <p>Chaudry hopes, though, that constructing the mosque will pave the way for reconciliation with those opponents who are willing to listen. \u201cI am a firm believer \u2013 perhaps I am more of an optimist than many people \u2013 but I feel that in human nature, when something has been done, people are more willing to accept it,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cThey will find that their fears were baseless.\u201d He has a strong \u2013 religious \u2013 faith in the notion that differences among people are best overcome through cultural interchange. \u201cMosques are places where you build those bridges,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A recent Cato Institute survey found that 47% of all Republicans \u2013 and a quarter of Americans overall \u2013 would support a ban on building new mosques in their communities. Yet Islamophobia, like all prejudices, is rooted in ignorance, and Chaudry felt that if people could just see the inside of a mosque, they would lose their apprehension. \u201cWe want to dispel some of these misperceptions that exist,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In addition to his many other activities, Chaudry often teaches about Islam, lecturing at venues ranging from universities to the New Jersey state police academy. Last autumn, he offered a continuing education course to some senior citizens, and he invited me to a culminating event, a tour of a large mosque in the town of South Brunswick. The retirees shuffled across the carpeted floor, awkward and shoeless, as the midday prayer began. The imam, Hamad Ahmad Chebli, welcomed what he called \u201c60 messengers\u201d.</p> <p>After the service, in an adjoining room, Chaudry and the imam took questions. Why were the women and men separated for prayers? Does the Qur\u2019an prohibit women from driving? What\u2019s the deal with sharia, and is it practiced in America? They answered each query patiently, providing some basic theology with a leavening dash of humour. A warm feeling of fellowship inflated like a soap bubble.</p> <p>\u201cI live nearby, and I\u2019ve driven by this Islamic Society any number of times,\u201d said one woman. \u201cAnd I always wondered, what\u2019s going on in there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaking Islamic bombs!\u201d Chebli interjected, eliciting a big laugh.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing,\u201d she went on, \u201cis we\u2019re dispelling the mystery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was a strong feeling in the mosque, a feeling of peace,\u201d said an elderly Jewish man. \u201cI was crying, because there was this beauty to all of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think occasions like this really help us all to understand what Islam and being a Muslim is all about,\u201d said another woman. \u201cAnd my biggest concern right now is what is happening to this country with our current president.\u201d</p> <p>There was a loud groan of disapproval.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bring politics into it \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why are you?\u201d shouted another audience member. The bubble was punctured.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica does not belong to any president,\u201d the imam said. \u201cAmerica does not belong to any religion. This is our country.\u201d Chaudry sought to defuse the sudden tension. He said he looked forward to welcoming more groups to visit, and learn, in Liberty Corner.</p> <p>\u201cInshallah,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we have our own mosque.\u201d</p> <p><em>All photographs by Fred R Conrad</em></p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Forty years ago, Mohammad Ali Chaudry, a Pakistani-born economist, made his home outside New York City. He came for an executive job at the telecoms company AT&amp;T, and ended up working there for decades. Like many immigrants to the US, Chaudry came to wholeheartedly believe \u2013 perhaps more fervently than his native-born neighbours \u2013 in the triumphal story that Americans tell about their nation: how it was always growing stronger through change, melding the many into one through the process of assimilation. Chaudry was a devout Muslim. But to him, it always seemed the things that made him different mattered less than the ways in which he had proved he was the same. Chaudry and his wife, who is from Italy, raised three children on a street called Manor Drive, in the town of Basking Ridge, in the centre of the state of New Jersey. This is not the \u201cJersey\u201d of popular imagination \u2013 the land of belching smokestacks immortalised in Bruce Springsteen\u2019s working-class anthems. Basking Ridge is out in horse country, an area of rolling green hills and white-steepled churches, not far from Bedminster, where Donald Trump has his summer estate. In keeping with the values of his adopted community, Chaudry became an active member of the local Republican party and a conspicuous civic presence, running for various elected boards. In 2004, at the height of George W Bush\u2019s war in Iraq, Chaudry became the first Pakistani-American to serve as mayor of a municipality in the US. Long after Chaudry retired from both AT&amp;T and electoral politics, he continued to keep a busy schedule of volunteer activities, most focused on building religious tolerance. He ran a small nonprofit organisation called the Center for Understanding Islam, and taught classes at local universities. Chaudry is bantam-sized, with a silvery moustache and a starchy manner, and despite his age \u2013 now 75 \u2013 he possesses a bottomless reservoir of diligent energy. He would travel the state, speaking to audiences young and old, always dressing the part of a politician, with a little American flag badge in his lapel. If there was prejudice around him in his adopted hometown, Chaudry later said that \u201cit was not obvious, or visible, or overt\u201d. That changed in 2011, when he found a new cause: building a mosque in Basking Ridge. For years, Chaudry and other local Muslims had been using a community centre for a makeshift Friday service. But Chaudry decided that the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge needed a permanent place to pray, and he located what he believed to be a suitable site: a four-acre lot occupied by a rundown Dutch Colonial house. Soon after purchasing it, Chaudry held an open house to greet the neighbours. \u201cThere was not too much tension,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of jovial.\u201d He put the letters \u201cISBR\u201d on the mailbox in front of the house, to announce the Islamic Society\u2019s arrival. Then someone smashed the mailbox. \u201cI was, of course, very surprised,\u201d Chaudry said. Under New Jersey\u2019s planning laws, the Islamic Society had to secure the approval of the municipal government to build the mosque, and from his experience as a public official, Chaudry knew that the town, which prided itself on its quaint homes and a history dating back to colonial times, was resistant to new development of any kind. But this was a house of worship, and he was someone well-known to the community. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I was expecting any favours,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cI expected them to be fair.\u201d What shocked him, though, was the hatred. That was seven long years ago, before some townspeople formed a group calling for \u201cresponsible development\u201d in furious opposition to the mosque, before the 39 planning board hearings, before the mosque was rejected, before Chaudry filed a lawsuit alleging religious prejudice, before his lawyers uncovered racially charged emails among officials opposed to his plan, before the Obama administration accused the town of civil rights violations, before national rightwing activists took notice of the dispute and began smearing Chaudry as a terrorist sympathiser, and before Trump dragged anti-Muslim conspiracy theories from the disreputable fringes into the White House. Today, Chaudry knows his town \u2013 and America \u2013 better. Long before Trump came along to capitalise on it, though, Islamophobia was building in the US, bubbling up like swamp gas from the depths. Often, racial conflict would manifest itself in small, seemingly isolated local planning fights over proposals to build mosques. The US Department of Justice, which staunchly defended the rights of Muslims during the Obama administration, noted a sharp increase in such mosque disputes between 2010 and 2016. Many took place in conservative locales such as rural Murfreesboro, Tennessee. But they also broke out in unexpected places such as Basking Ridge: a wealthy and well-educated community in the outwardly tolerant north-eastern US. Basking Ridge is governed by a five-person elected committee, which meets in a repurposed Tudor-style mansion. (It previously belonged to John Jacob Astor VI, an American aristocrat whose father perished on the Titanic.) One evening last year, I attended a meeting \u2013 the first of many \u2013 at the town hall, where the committee members sat on a long dais, discussing their usual business, such as preparations for an upcoming celebration of the signing of Basking Ridge\u2019s royal charter, in 1760. When the meeting was opened to comments from the public, however, all anyone wanted to talk about was Chaudry and the mosque. \u201cThe neighbours near this proposed mosque did not sign up to live next to this house of worship,\u201d said one resident, who broke down sobbing as she spoke. \u201cThey have been members of a quiet residential neighbourhood for decades, and do not look forward to having their routines and lives disrupted.\u201d The residents said the mosque would create traffic and commotion, and would ruin their property values. But they also complained about the tactics Chaudry had employed in his bitter court battle. One middle-aged woman gestured toward the mosque opponents in the audience, saying that many had been subjected to \u201ca hateful harassment campaign\u201d by the Islamic Society\u2019s attorneys, who had served them with subpoenas seeking the contents of their personal email and social media accounts, in an effort to prove that they were motivated not by planning concerns, but animosity toward Muslims. \u201cMr Chaudry has waged an expensive PR campaign that has talked about people as if they\u2019re bigots,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd personally, I think it is the ISBR group that has been bullying and bigoted.\u201d Then she invoked Trump, the inescapable presence. \u201cThey talk about our current president and how he speaks about Muslims. Well, I find ISBR\u2019s rhetoric to be just as harmful.\u201d Finally, Loretta Quick, a schoolteacher who lived next door to the mosque site, got up to speak. She was one of the neighbours who had come to Chaudry\u2019s initial open house years before. She had even voted for him, back when he was a politician. Now she was a die-hard enemy of the mosque. \u201cIf you cave,\u201d she told the board, in a furious voice, \u201cyou\u2019re saying that we are bigots, that we based the decision on discrimination against Islam.\u201d Quick was one of those who had been served with a subpoena, and was being represented by the Thomas More Law Center, an advocacy group that claims its mission is to defend \u201cAmerica\u2019s Judeo-Christian heritage and moral values\u201d against forces waging a \u201cStealth Jihad\u201d to \u201ctransform America into an Islamic nation\u201d. Quick referenced a recent press release the Law Center had put out, which had plucked a few verses from a searchable English translation of the Qur\u2019an that could be accessed on the ISBR website \u2013 \u201cFight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them\u201d, etc \u2013 to suggest that Chaudry was somehow in league with religious extremists. \u201cThese are words that seem quite intimidating and threatening to me,\u201d Quick said. \u201cI want to be protected, and you owe that to me, this township and this nation.\u201d * * * How did a small-town property dispute turn into a religious war, with legal and symbolic implications for all of America? Part of the answer has to do with the country\u2019s labyrinthine land-use laws, which leave most control to state and local governments, which are in turn vulnerable to the furies of angry mobs. Part of it has to do with America\u2019s love of litigation. The inherently confrontational and intrusive legal process had a radicalising effect on the town, driving some opponents of the development to extremes. But something else deeper and darker seemed to be at work. Some residents openly discussed Islamophobic conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the mosque was meant to send a message of conquest, due to its proximity to the town\u2019s September 11 memorial. Such crackpot notions, promoted by far-right ideologues such as Pamela Geller and Frank Gaffney, used to be confined to the margins of the internet. Then Trump embraced the Islamophobes, unabashedly. \u201cIt\u2019s like his election has given permission to people,\u201d Chaudry told me the first time we met. We were at the proposed site of the mosque, sitting in the old suburban house that he was still hoping to demolish. Its living room, dominated by a large stone fireplace, was filled with boxes of donated clothes that he was preparing to deliver to a family of Syrian refugees. The many bookshelves were lined with theological texts and stacked copies of a paperback that Chaudry likes to give out, Islam Denounces Terrorism. Standing on an easel in a corner was a poster-sized rendering of the proposed mosque. In an effort to make it fit into its suburban surroundings, it had been designed to resemble a mini-mansion, with gray clapboard siding, a pitched roof with asphalt shingles, dormer windows and minarets disguised as chimneys. But the architecture did little to defuse tensions with the surrounding neighbourhood. Liberty Corner considered itself separate from the older and wealthier village of Basking Ridge, though they were both part of the same larger township, and few outsiders recognised the geographical distinction. And as even Chaudry and his allies admitted, some of the locals had a stubborn and ecumenical commitment to protesting anyone who dared to build anything, including Christian churches. People in Liberty Corner expressed an obstreperous ideology often abbreviated as \u201cnimby\u201d, for \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d. The opponents of the mosque told their own story of victimisation, in which they were merely objecting to Chaudry\u2019s oppressive development scheme. \u201cIt was always about land use,\u201d one Liberty Corner resident told me. \u201cThey made it about religion.\u201d The nimby complainers claimed that the mosque site \u2013 a marshy plot on a mainly residential street \u2013 was a poor location for a busy house of prayer. When the township planning board took up Chaudry\u2019s proposal in August 2012, signs soon appeared in front yards around town, reading \u201cPreserve Liberty Corner\u201d. At one of the first planning hearings, a resident named Lori Caratzola stood up to challenge Chaudry. A law graduate, she cross-examined him about the size of the Islamic Society, accusing him of understating its membership. She revealed that she had done surveillance of a Friday service, counting 125 worshippers going into a space with a capacity for 60. After her confrontational performance, Caratzola became a leader of the opposition. At the public hearings, Caratzola and others confined their criticisms to the nimby issues: drainage, parking, landscaping and the like. They convinced the board that a mosque would need more parking spaces than a church, because midday worshippers would come alone. When the Islamic Society submitted a new plan, with a larger parking lot, the mosque\u2019s opponents protested that, too. It quickly became clear that the opposition was not solely concerned with parking. Around the time the hearings began, some residents received an anonymous piece of mail. Inside was a letter entitled \u201cMeet Your New Neighbor\u201d, and a CD containing a recording of a radio interview in which Chaudry had offered some mildly nuanced opinions on Israel, Hamas and Hezbollah. \u201cHere in Basking Ridge, on the surface, we see the serene, grinning academic Ali Chaudry, always willing to help us better understand the version of Islam he wants us to know,\u201d the letter read. \u201cScratch the surface a little and an uglier picture emerges.\u201d The author of the letter tenuously linked Chaudry to the Muslim Brotherhood and the \u201cGround Zero mosque\u201d \u2013 a proposed Islamic community centre in Lower Manhattan that Pamela Geller and Fox News had recently whipped up into a national controversy. It cited the term taqiyya, an obscure theological concept that Islamophobes often twist to suggest that Muslims are encouraged to lie about the true nature of their violent beliefs. \u201cSo, welcome to the neighbourhood, Ali,\u201d the letter concluded. \u201cLet\u2019s ask Ali about those Koranic verses regarding Jews and Christians in your Koran. Why are so many terroristic acts propagated by Muslims? Is it something they are taught in your mosques and at home? And what will you teach in your new Liberty Corner mosque? You wouldn\u2019t lie to us, would you? Taqiyya is wrong, right?\u201d * * * Just as the author of the letter accused Muslims of deception, the Islamic Society, in its lawsuit, alleged that many of the neighbours were presenting a false front, using preservationist sentiment to disguise their real, less respectable fears. \u201cThe key thing to remember,\u201d said Adeel Mangi, an attorney for the Islamic Society, \u201cis that these complaints are commonly used as a smokescreen.\u201d There is, literally, an anti-mosque playbook. Tactics were once unwritten, spread through websites and word of mouth, but more recently they were set down in a book titled Mosques in America: A Guide to Accountable Permit Hearings and Continuing Citizen Oversight. Written a Texas attorney, it was published by the Center for Security Policy, an organisation headed by Frank Gaffney, a former Reagan administration official who has long espoused the theory that Muslims are engaged in a secret plot to impose sharia law on the US. Gaffney writes in the book\u2019s introduction that it is a \u201chow-to manual for patriotic Americans who are ready to counter the leading edge of Islamic supremacism\u201d. The manual offers lessons from cases like the one in Basking Ridge. \u201cIt may be startling to consider, but Islamists are entitled to exploit liberal free speech rights to advance their political and legal operations,\u201d the author warns. It advises residents to express objections in the manner most likely to sway the authorities, avoiding mention of religious issues. \u201cConcerned citizens must learn to express questions and reservations in a manner appropriate to the relevant civic forum\u2019s purpose,\u201d the manual says, instructing readers that \u201crather than expressing alarm as hysteria, speaking to local government officials and media requires a strategic response based on reason, facts, precedents, and the law\u201d. Sure enough, the transcripts of the dozens of hearings held by the town\u2019s planning board, which run to nearly 7,000 pages, contain no mention of sharia, the Muslim Brotherhood or other rightwing hobgoblins. Most residents swore that religion had nothing to do with their opposition. But the Islamic society\u2019s lawyers suspected \u2013 and would later allege in court \u2013 that their opponents were showing another face when they talked to each other on the internet. A commenter named \u201cLC\u201d \u2013 who appeared to be Caratzola \u2013 often expressed anti-Muslim sentiments when the mosque was debated on local web forums and national sites with names such as Bare Naked Islam. (Motto: \u201cIt isn\u2019t Islamophobia when they really ARE trying to kill you.\u201d) Caratzola was also listed as a member of a Gaffney-affiliated group set up to defend against the supposedly creeping influence of sharia on US courts. (\u201cI stand by that,\u201d Caratzola later told the New York Times, claiming that \u201cevery single terrorist attack in the last 20 years was committed by Muslims\u201d.) In December 2015, a few days after a Muslim husband and wife killed 14 people in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, and shortly before candidate Donald Trump proposed a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d of Muslim immigration, the town\u2019s planning board voted to reject the mosque. At Caratzola\u2019s urging, the town government also adopted a new ordinance that raised the minimum size of the plot required to build any new house of worship \u2013 which would effectively prevent the Islamic Society from building on its own site in the future. The Islamic Society quickly filed a lawsuit against the township, alleging the opposition was a \u201cwell-funded machine\u201d that was \u201csubstantially grounded in anti-Muslim animus\u201d. The lawsuit particularly highlighted Caratzola\u2019s role as a ringleader of the opposition. In a letter to a local newspaper, she accused the Islamic Society of \u201cslander\u201d \u2013 and invoked the concept of taqiyya to suggest that Chaudry\u2019s mosque proposal was not what it seemed. \u201cMany people and groups in the Muslim community,\u201d she wrote, \u201care trying to quash what we so fervently cherish in America \u2013 the freedom of speech.\u201d The Islamic Society also claimed it had the constitution on its side \u2013 specifically, the first-amendment protection of the freedoms of religion and assembly. And Chaudry could call upon a powerful ally: Barack Obama. Under his administration, the Justice Department intervened on behalf of Muslims in many mosque disputes, including a highly publicised case in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where the construction of a mosque was opposed with lawsuits, protests and an arson attack. It was able to rely on a powerful legal tool: a law, originally passed with bipartisan support in 2000, that specifically bans local governments from discriminating against religious organisations when it comes to land use. The enforcement policy \u201creflected the fact that Islamophobia is a real problem across America\u201d, said Tom Perez, who handled the Murfreesboro case as a director of the Civil Rights Division. (He is currently chairman of the Democratic National Committee.) \u201cI think as you see the proliferation of social media, the world has gotten smaller,\u201d Perez told me. \u201cPeople who harbour these extreme views have a virtual platform to spread their hate.\u201d In 2016, the US Justice Department filed its own lawsuit, claiming that the local planning board violated the Islamic Society\u2019s rights in rejecting its building plan. To Islamophobic activists, who spent the eight years of Obama\u2019s presidency promoting conspiracy theories about his birth certificate and suggesting he was secretly a Muslim, such moves were yet more evidence of the administration\u2019s suspiciously sympathetic stance toward Islam. \u201cIslamic supremacists and Muslim Brotherhood organisations \u2026 called upon their running dogs at the Department of Justice to impose the sharia and usurp American law for Islamic law,\u201d Pam Geller wrote in a blogpost about the Basking Ridge mosque case. \u201cWhat small town can go up against the US government\u2019s vast resources and endless taxpayer-funded muscle?\u201d The federal government\u2019s intervention had a radicalising effect in Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood\u2019s enemy was no longer a pushy former mayor; it was President Obama. Then, as if a Justice Department investigation wasn\u2019t intrusive enough, private citizens started receiving knocks on their doors from people carrying subpoenas, seeking to probe their email and social media accounts. The Islamic Society\u2019s lawyers \u2013 members of a prestigious Manhattan firm that was working pro-bono \u2013 wanted to prove that Caratzola was really the commenter \u201cLC\u201d, and that she and her allies were communicating their true attitudes to each other \u2013 and to their elected leaders \u2013 outside of the public meetings. Understandably, though, the private citizens felt threatened by the intrusion. Their complaints attracted the attention of the Thomas More Law Center, which intervened on the behalf of residents seeking to quash the subpoenas, claiming that the demand would have a chilling effect on free speech. On its website, the Law Center decried the \u201coutrageous unconstitutional intimidation\u201d, alongside a heroic photo of Caratzola standing in front of an American flag. \u201cLori Caratzola,\u201d the caption read. \u201cPersecuted for opposing the mosque.\u201d * * * On 31 December 2016, a federal judge issued a preliminary decision in the Basking Ridge case, finding that the planning board had exercised \u201cunbridled and unconstitutional discretion\u201d in requiring the mosque to have more parking than other houses of worship. Though the case was far from over, it was clear that the law favoured Chaudry. The victory rang hollow, though. Trump had just been elected president, giving a jarring rebuke to liberal values, and placing Muslim-Americans like Chaudry in a newly precarious position. As a candidate, to bolster his call for a ban on Muslim immigration, Trump had often cited the research from the Center for Security Policy, Gaffney\u2019s group. (\u201cVery highly respected people, who I know, actually.\u201d) Some of his most important advisers, such as Steve Bannon and Mike Pompeo, soon to be named the CIA director, were outspoken Gaffney admirers. Gaffney saluted the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions \u2013 the 2015 winner of the Center for Security Policy\u2019s \u201cKeeper of the Flame\u201d award \u2013 for his vigilance \u201cagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic\u201d. With Sessions and other members of the nativist right in charge of the federal government, the Justice Department\u2019s commitment toward protecting Muslims and their mosques looked shaky. On a chilly Friday in April last year, still early in Trump\u2019s presidency, I helped Chaudry as he performed his weekly ritual, carrying items from the garage of the old house in Liberty Corner to his gold Toyota SUV. In went eight rolled-up prayer rugs, then the plastic donation boxes, the folding music stand that serves as a lectern, the sound system, the digital clock, which was synchronised with Mecca, and four decorative mats, which Chaudry uses to slightly sanctify the drab walls of the community centre that the Islamic Society currently uses for its Jummah service. When the SUV, known as the \u201cMosque Mobile\u201d, was full, Chaudry would drive it across town for prayers. \u201cI\u2019m just overwhelmed with everything that is going on,\u201d he said as we got in the car. For the past few months, Trump had been fighting to impose his ban on travellers from seven Muslim-majority nations, sparking court confrontations and massive protests. Chaudry was responding to the crisis with a characteristic burst of civic activity, participating in political forums and interfaith vigils. The relationship between Muslim communities and their government was wary at the best of times, and Trump was making it much worse, but Chaudry saw himself as a trust-building emissary. He served on advisory panels to law enforcement. A few weeks before, he\u2019d spoken about discrimination and the travel ban at a worried meeting between Muslim leaders and many prominent New Jersey politicians. At the forum, as he did nearly everywhere he went, Chaudry promoted an earnest personal cause, asking everyone present to take a formal pledge he\u2019d composed, to \u201cStand up for the Other\u201d. The Mosque Mobile turned on to Church Street, the main road through Liberty Corner. The neighbourhood traced its name back to the American revolution, and the whole town took great patriotic pride in the role it had played in the independence struggle, as a stronghold for George Washington\u2019s army. Chaudry took a roundabout route, pointing out horse farms and new tract developments, and a park where the Islamic Society prayed when the community centre was used for a summer camp. \u201cWhere the flag is, this is the 9/11 memorial,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cI was on the township committee when we did that. Eighteen people here died.\u201d A wooded road took us into Basking Ridge. In the yard of its Presbyterian church, founded in 1717, stood an ancient tree known as the \u201cHoly Oak\u201d, where Washington is said to have picnicked with the Marquis de Lafayette. At the community centre, we were joined by Chaudry\u2019s wife, Victoria. We rolled out the mats and set up the speakers, and used a 30-metre (100-ft) sound cable to connect the small main room with an adjacent annex, which was used for overflow. Chaudry pointed, proudly, to his name on a plaque on the wall \u2013 he had helped to establish the centre. About a decade before, he and around a dozen other Muslims had started gathering there. But there were more Muslims around than he realised, working as doctors in the area\u2019s hospitals, or as scientists in its many pharmaceutical firms, or as engineers at a big telecommunications company. The Islamic Society had long ago outgrown its temporary space. The worshippers began to arrive, most of them men coming from office jobs, plastic ID badges hanging from their belts. They dropped their shoes in an unruly pile near the centre\u2019s doorway, and used a cramped galley kitchen to perform wudu, the Muslim washing ritual. Then they knelt down as the muezzin sang a call to prayer. Because it lacked a permanent home, the Islamic Society had no imam, and it relied on a rotating cast to lead services. This week\u2019s visitor, Chaudry told me, was known as \u201cthe crying imam\u201d. That week, dozens of Syrian civilians, including many children, had been killed in a poison gas attack, and the night before, Trump had fired cruise missiles in reprisal. The imam, dressed in a long black robe, led a prayer for \u201cour brothers and sisters in Syria\u201d. His voice trembling, he sobbed, \u201cGive peace to this region.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one of his characteristics,\u201d Chaudry said after the service. \u201cHe does become emotional.\u201d Most of the worshippers, who numbered around 70 in all, quickly returned to their cars and hurried back to work. Chaudry repacked the Mosque Mobile. \u201cI\u2019ve been carrying these rugs for more than 10 years now, and I\u2019m tired of doing it,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe need to have a place of our own.\u201d As we drove out of Basking Ridge, Chaudry pointed out the Holy Oak, standing tall in the churchyard. The tree was rotten, he told me. Later that month, it would be cut down, and its dead branches handed out to townspeople as patriotic keepsakes. * * * Despite Trump\u2019s election, Chaudry still retained his hope for justice, at least for his congregation. The case was now in the courts, which meant the Justice Department couldn\u2019t easily abandon it. The town\u2019s government, facing an almost certain legal defeat, was under pressure from its insurance company to settle its lawsuit with the Islamic Society quickly, before a trial. Throughout the spring and summer of 2017, negotiations dragged on over a settlement, which would include a large damages payment to the Islamic Society. I attended endless meetings of the township\u2019s elected committee, at which angry citizens would demand information from stone-faced board members, inveighing against the settlement in increasingly apocalyptic terms. Chaudry attended with other members of the Islamic Society. He sat in the front row but said nothing, keeping his head down and scribbling in a pad, showing no emotion even in the face of incendiary provocations. The opponents were a surprisingly diverse lot. There were some old-money Protestants, who complained that the hubbub would bother their horses. But some of the most emotional speakers were new residents, many of them immigrants from south and east Asia. At one meeting, one of the Islamic Society\u2019s closest neighbours, a medical professional from India who was building a large house directly behind the mosque plot, stood up and addressed the Muslims in the audience directly. \u201cIf you are somehow able to get a mosque built, you will create a divide which you will not be able to bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, if the site would move to another appropriate location, you will earn our respect, and you will truly earn the right to build a mosque in this town. What is it that you want, to just build a mosque, or set an example for the whole country?\u201d By the perverse logic of the mosque opponents, it was the Islamic Society that had brought discrimination upon itself, by suing over discrimination. There was only one thing the Muslims could do to prove themselves worthy neighbours: go somewhere else. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to say, though, that everyone who spoke against the mosque was religiously motivated. Many, if not most, of the adversaries appeared to be genuinely impassioned in their opposition to development in Liberty Corner. \u201cSure, there\u2019s a 5% lunatic fringe,\u201d Paul Zubulake told me one evening while sitting on a bench outside the town hall, waiting for yet another meeting to begin. But he said that for him, and many others, religion was beside the point: \u201cIt\u2019s about our quality of life. It\u2019s going to destroy our community.\u201d To show me what he loved about Liberty Corner, Zubalake invited me to visit his home, a few doors down from the Islamic Society property. When I arrived, on a rainy Memorial Day in late May, a soggy town parade was making its way down the main thoroughfare, Church Street. As Zubulake was introducing me to his family \u2013 explaining that his son has autism, and they had moved to the area for his schooling \u2013 he spotted the mayor marching by with other members of the township committee. He dashed down to the roadside and shouted: \u201cThere\u2019s still time!\u201d The politicians frowned and kept marching down Church Street. \u201cI just want them to know how pissed off I am,\u201d Zubulake said. Chaudry, meanwhile, had organised a contingent from the Islamic Society to march in the Memorial Day parade. They met in front of the house, next to a sign that Chaudry had staked in the yard, reading: \u201cProud to Be An American.\u201d Whether by chance or intention, the parade\u2019s organisers had put the Islamic Society at the very rear, right behind another marginalised group, the local Democrats. Chaudry coaxed the children who were marching with the Islamic Society\u2019s banner to stay in a tight formation. \u201cGood morning!\u201d he called from beneath a big black umbrella, waving an American flag with his free hand. The parade route ended at a war memorial, where Chaudry left a wreath with a mosque insignia. \u201cMy advice to the community has always been that this is not the time to hide,\u201d Chaudry told me later. \u201cYou have to be out there, fighting for your rights.\u201d To some people in Basking Ridge, Chaudry\u2019s struggle looked less noble. They saw his battle with the town government as a local political feud, which dated back to his tenure as an elected official, long before he ever proposed the mosque. Chaudry had first run for a seat on the town committee in 2001. After September 11, which hit the commuter town hard, he told the local newspaper: \u201cWe are all under attack.\u201d But a Republican party leader called him to suggest it might be better if his campaign signs, which read \u201cAli Chaudry\u201d, just used his last name. \u201cI said everyone knows who I am,\u201d Chaudry told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never kept it a secret.\u201d He won the election. But he was not universally popular. The way the local government worked, the office of mayor rotated annually among the elected members of the township committee. In 2004, it was Chaudry\u2019s turn. As the US\u2019s first Pakistani-American mayor, he made a triumphant visit to his homeland, where he met with the foreign minister, and gave interviews in which he hinted that he had ambitions for higher office. But local critics found him arrogant and high-handed. The next time he was up for election, he held on to his committee seat by just 11 votes. The local Republican party was also in the midst of a schism, and Chaudry and his allies were ultimately driven out by a more conservative faction, which ran on the slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Take Your Town Back.\u201d The bad blood spilled over into the mosque dispute. The most damning evidence produced by the Islamic Society in the course of its lawsuit came from the correspondence of the town\u2019s elected officials, many of whom had formerly served and clashed with Chaudry. They expressed their hostility in raw, racially offensive terms. A town committee member named John Malay compared Chaudry to a stereotypically shifty native character in the 1930s film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. \u201cWe [finally] ousted him, whereupon he went to Mecca, got a funny hat and declared himself the imam of a new mosque here in town,\u201d Malay wrote. \u201cReligion trumps even politics as a refuge for scoundrels, I guess.\u201d Other emails contained jokes about Muslims, pigs and Barack Obama. \u201cMan child,\u201d John Carpenter, another committee member, wrote of Obama. \u201cThe product of fools, raised by idiots and coddled by affirmative action. Behold the beast.\u201d The emails revealed that Carpenter had even lobbied to prevent Chaudry from participating in a September 11 commemoration ceremony, alleging he was an extremist. \u201c[Find] a real moderate Muslim,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere must be one. We shouldn\u2019t look the other way on his views \u2013 we owe that to our dead residents. Let\u2019s make it happen without that fool.\u201d When the correspondence came out in court filings, Carpenter offered no apologies. \u201cYou should not confuse contempt with bigotry,\u201d he told a newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to not like the guy.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just a funny guy with this identity thing,\u201d Carpenter told me when we met for coffee at a diner over the summer. \u201cHe was known as, quote, \u2018Mr Muslim\u2019.\u201d Carpenter, a tall, balding salesman, had served on the town committee for more than a decade, and was running for re-election. He was outraged that his unguarded words had been used to portray him \u2013 and the entire township \u2013 as racist. \u201cWhen government tries to see into someone\u2019s heart, that\u2019s when we fall into totalitarianism,\u201d he told me. He advanced a conspiratorial theory, which I heard from other mosque opponents, that Chaudry had been \u201cengineering failure\u201d all along, so that he could sue and win millions in damages, as other mosques had done. He said he believed that Chaudry and the Obama administration had been conspiring. A Justice Department official involved in the investigation of the township, he noted, served with Chaudry on the board of a local university\u2019s Center on Religion, Culture and Conflict. (Chaudry says they never discussed the case.) \u201cI find it ironic that he served on this council for religious conflict, and what he really was trying to do here \u2013 and I don\u2019t think he succeeded in the end, because people see through it \u2013 is create a religious conflict,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI don\u2019t think what happened is fair to the people of the town, and I think it\u2019s important for other people around the country to know what\u2019s coming their way.\u201d Carpenter said he had been hopeful that Trump\u2019s election would bring \u201ca little sanity to the Department of Justice\u201d, and a reversal of its stance on the mosque case, but so far, he had been disappointed. He knew the president was spending his summer vacation at his private club in Bedminster, though, just a quick drive away from Basking Ridge. \u201cHe\u2019s there for three weeks,\u201d joked Carpenter, an avid cyclist. \u201cMaybe I could sneak in, ride my bike up the back road: I need to speak to the president!\u201d * * * All year long, as I kept returning to see Chaudry, Donald Trump loomed over our conversation. One Saturday morning in September, on my way to meet Chaudry at a Lutheran Church\u2019s symposium on \u201cRace, Hatred and Bigotry\u201d, I looked up in the sky and saw the presidential helicopter heading toward Bedminster. Trump\u2019s embrace of the worst in politics \u2013 fanning terrorism hysteria, retweeting racist memes, refusing to condemn the white nationalist demonstrators in Charlottesville \u2013 had real consequences on the ground. \u201cPeople are emboldened to come out and say things that they never felt they could say before,\u201d Chaudry told the symposium. \u201cThey have a licence, because the person in the highest office of the country is engaging in that kind of language.\u201dAt one point, the room suddenly filled with a disconcerting roar from low-flying military jets. Chaudry introduced a pair of high school girls, one of whom was wearing hijab, who eloquently described their experiences with bullying confrontations on the school bus and social media platforms. \u201cI would say to my non-Muslim friends: this is the Muslim community,\u201d Chaudry said when they finished their presentation. As the controversy over the mosque moved toward a settlement, the town committee held a series of heated public hearings. Many members of the Islamic Society attended, to show a human face to their neighbours. They always took care to present themselves as model citizens: upscale professionals, and the parents of striving children. \u201cWe are not some strange boogeyman that came out of nowhere,\u201d Yasmine Khalil told me. She was a doctor and a vocal mosque supporter, who had moved to the township from Manhattan a few years before. Khalil said she had been dismayed to see the ugliness infiltrate even a private Facebook group for local mothers, where she had got into commenting wars about Islam. \u201cWhen I wasn\u2019t just quiet and silent and in the background,\u201d she said, \u201cthey took it upon themselves to kick me out.\u201d At one public meeting, a white-haired man \u2013 one of the crustier opposing voices \u2013 tripped and fell, and Khalil rushed across the room, thinking he might need medical assistance. He was fine, and the meeting went on. Khalil gave a speech, introducing herself as a mother. \u201cWe are your friends, we are your neighbours \u2013 I could be your doctor,\u201d Khalil said. \u201cI want my kids to feel like they\u2019re welcomed. I want my kids to feel proud of the people that we have chosen to surround them with.\u201d The old man she had just rushed to help piped up: \u201cMove to an appropriate place!\u201d Chaudry said non-Muslims in Basking Ridge would often pull him aside, to quietly confide that they were ashamed about what was happening to the town. He hoped that, at some point, the forces of conciliation would make themselves heard. Instead, the tenor of the debate only grew more hysterical. It reached its climax when a particularly vociferous mosque opponent named Nick Xu, a Chinese-American volunteer for Trump\u2019s campaign, gave a speech claiming that the Islamic Society\u2019s lawsuit was part of a \u201csystematic plot\u201d to wage war through the courts. \u201cIf you google \u2018Islamic Lawfare\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see dozens, dozens of these kind of lawsuits.\u201d In response to Xu, a man named James Rickey \u2013 a member of one of the town\u2019s old Scots-Irish families \u2013 came to his feet, full of righteous contempt. \u201cThe tone that has been used here tonight is disgraceful,\u201d Rickey said. \u201cWe\u2019re all human beings. We should respect each other.\u201d With that, and without debate, the town committee grimly voted to approve the settlement, agreeing to reverse the planning board\u2019s rejection while paying the Islamic Society $3.5m. John Carpenter was the lone dissenter. The townspeople again raised a loud clamour. \u201cWe understand your frustration,\u201d the mayor told them. \u201cBut this is what we are required to do by federal law.\u201d A few weeks later, the Islamic Society celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadan beneath a white tent set up next to a practice green at the Basking Ridge Country Club. Chaudry addressed the service while standing next to a poster-sized rendering of the mosque. \u201cAs many of you know,\u201d he said, \u201cwe now have \u2013 alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah, alhamdulillah \u2013 a settlement with the township, which calls for us to submit a revised plan, and I am honoured to tell you that at 4.49pm yesterday I received from our engineers the plan that we intend to submit tomorrow, inshallah. Many people thought this was impossible. As Nelson Mandela said once, things seem impossible until they are done.\u201d For the holiday, Chaudry had secured the services of a guest imam who spoke of the \u201cconstant shockwave\u201d that Trump\u2019s election had sent through the Muslim community in America. When the prayers were finished, Chaudry stood at the front of the tent and accepted congratulations from members of his congregation. \u201cPeople said, why are we doing this here, where people don\u2019t like us?\u201d he told one. \u201cI say, where can you go where people like you?\u201d * * * It is not yet clear what the Trump presidency will mean for the Justice Department\u2019s policy on mosque disputes. Eric Rassbach, an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an anti-discrimination advocacy group, told me that so far the department \u201cseems to be staying the course\u201d. Still, ideological shifts take time to assert themselves within government bureaucracies, and Tom Perez said there is \u201cevery reason to be concerned\u201d about the Justice Department\u2019s direction. \u201cDonald Trump certainly adds gas to the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will bring additional pressure to bear on the DOJ to do the wrong thing.\u201d Chaudry no longer considered himself a Republican, for obvious reasons, but he was still guarded in his criticism of Trump. All summer, while the president vacationed nearby, a few self-proclaimed members of the resistance would protest on a street corner in Bedminster. Chaudry never participated. Instead, he organised interfaith prayer services, and tried to be a moderating force. When an alleged Islamic State supporter from New Jersey killed eight people with a truck on a Manhattan bike path in October, Chaudry hastened to arrange a reassuring visit of police officials to a mosque near the suspect\u2019s home, which was receiving death threats. Meanwhile, every time Trump tweeted something horrible about Muslims, Chaudry would wearily draw up a public statement. \u201cWith him, you can never tell what he\u2019s going to say,\u201d he said. Under the terms of the Islamic Society\u2019s settlement, the mosque was granted a rehearing before the planning board in August, at which \u201cno commentary regarding Islam or Muslims\u201d was to be considered. The procedure was a mere formality, and the mosque was approved. Lori Caratzola, who recently moved out of Basking Ridge, was not present for the vote. She did not respond to interview requests; neither did the Thomas More Law Center, the rightwing group that came to her aid in the Islamic Society\u2019s lawsuit. With the federal case concluded, the issue of the subpoenas to private citizens is now moot. But the Thomas More Law Center has continued to file lawsuits on the behalf of other mosque opponents, including neighbour Loretta Quick, claiming that their elected representatives had \u201ccolluded with ISBR\u2019s \u2018Civilization Jihad\u2019\u201d. Another lawsuit, brought by a former member of the planning board, is challenging the mosque\u2019s approval on procedural grounds. \u201cIt\u2019s far from over,\u201d Zubulake told me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting it to the bitter end.\u201d While continuing to fight on the legal front, Chaudry is now raising funds \u2013 much of the settlement went to pay his lawyers, who are in turn donating the money to charity \u2013 while also going through the permitting process. He hopes to demolish the house soon, so he can hold a groundbreaking ceremony some time in 2018. One person who won\u2019t be attending is the current town mayor, John Carpenter. He promptly appointed Nick Xu \u2013 the \u201cIslamic lawfare\u201d guy \u2013 to a pair of township boards. Chaudry hopes, though, that constructing the mosque will pave the way for reconciliation with those opponents who are willing to listen. \u201cI am a firm believer \u2013 perhaps I am more of an optimist than many people \u2013 but I feel that in human nature, when something has been done, people are more willing to accept it,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cThey will find that their fears were baseless.\u201d He has a strong \u2013 religious \u2013 faith in the notion that differences among people are best overcome through cultural interchange. \u201cMosques are places where you build those bridges,\u201d he said. A recent Cato Institute survey found that 47% of all Republicans \u2013 and a quarter of Americans overall \u2013 would support a ban on building new mosques in their communities. Yet Islamophobia, like all prejudices, is rooted in ignorance, and Chaudry felt that if people could just see the inside of a mosque, they would lose their apprehension. \u201cWe want to dispel some of these misperceptions that exist,\u201d he said. In addition to his many other activities, Chaudry often teaches about Islam, lecturing at venues ranging from universities to the New Jersey state police academy. Last autumn, he offered a continuing education course to some senior citizens, and he invited me to a culminating event, a tour of a large mosque in the town of South Brunswick. The retirees shuffled across the carpeted floor, awkward and shoeless, as the midday prayer began. The imam, Hamad Ahmad Chebli, welcomed what he called \u201c60 messengers\u201d. After the service, in an adjoining room, Chaudry and the imam took questions. Why were the women and men separated for prayers? Does the Qur\u2019an prohibit women from driving? What\u2019s the deal with sharia, and is it practiced in America? They answered each query patiently, providing some basic theology with a leavening dash of humour. A warm feeling of fellowship inflated like a soap bubble. \u201cI live nearby, and I\u2019ve driven by this Islamic Society any number of times,\u201d said one woman. \u201cAnd I always wondered, what\u2019s going on in there?\u201d \u201cMaking Islamic bombs!\u201d Chebli interjected, eliciting a big laugh. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing,\u201d she went on, \u201cis we\u2019re dispelling the mystery.\u201d \u201cThere was a strong feeling in the mosque, a feeling of peace,\u201d said an elderly Jewish man. \u201cI was crying, because there was this beauty to all of it.\u201d \u201cI think occasions like this really help us all to understand what Islam and being a Muslim is all about,\u201d said another woman. \u201cAnd my biggest concern right now is what is happening to this country with our current president.\u201d There was a loud groan of disapproval. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bring politics into it \u2026 \u201d \u201cThen why are you?\u201d shouted another audience member. The bubble was punctured. \u201cAmerica does not belong to any president,\u201d the imam said. \u201cAmerica does not belong to any religion. This is our country.\u201d Chaudry sought to defuse the sudden tension. He said he looked forward to welcoming more groups to visit, and learn, in Liberty Corner. \u201cInshallah,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen we have our own mosque.\u201d All photographs by Fred R Conrad \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>What a difference a decade makes. \u201cIf I had to write that song again, I probably would make an edit on it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-would-rewrite-i-kissed-a-girl-video\">Katy Perry recently told Glamour magazine</a> of her 2009 breakthrough hit, I Kissed a Girl. \u201cLyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much. What\u2019s true for you can evolve.\u201d</p> <p>Given that I Kissed a Girl is little more than a piece of titillation \u2013 \u201cI hope my boyfriend don\u2019t mind it / It felt so wrong / It felt so right\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not at all sure removing a couple of stereotypes from it would make much difference. And there was no mention from Perry of her contemporaneous and even more are-you-really-sure-you-want-to-go-there <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3mSLW60i_k&amp;list=RDo3mSLW60i_k&amp;t=7\">Ur So Gay</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAp9BKosZXs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tAp9BKosZXs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Katy Perry: I Kissed a Girl \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But the impulse is right, and one as old as song itself. Folk songs changed lyrics to fit geographical and temporal needs, or just because the lyrics got lost along the way in ages when they were not recorded on paper or on tape. The growth of recorded music, and of the mass market for music sales and performance, hastened the process.</p> <p>At one end of the spectrum are the lyric changes that seem halfhearted at best, a will-this-do shrug. Like the Rolling Stones altering the lyric of Stray Cat Blues in live performance, so Mick Jagger is no longer inviting a 15-year-old girl and her friend to have it off with him. \u201cIt\u2019s no hanging matter,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s no capital crime.\u201d No, but it will get you a prison sentence and intense disapproval. So these days Jagger sings instead of a 16-year-old girl. Which, obviously, is not creepy and unpleasant at all.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVZH7IdHP2E\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVZH7IdHP2E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Rolling Stones: Stray Cat Blues - video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>If one goes back to the 1920s and 30s, the array of songs whose lyrics changed to reflect changing sensibilities is eye-opening. Oscar Hammerstein\u2019s original lyrics for Ol\u2019 Man River made use of the N-word, but when Show Boat was filmed in 1936, nine years after the original Broadway production, that word had changed to become \u201cdarkies\u201d. A decade on, when it was revived on Broadway, that in turn changed to \u201ccoloured folks\u201d, and when Frank Sinatra sang it in the 1946 Jerome Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By, it wasn\u2019t even \u201ccoloured folks\u201d working \u201cwhile de white folks play\u201d \u2013 instead: \u201chere we all work\u201d.</p> <p>Cole Porter\u2019s songs, too, were made more sensitive to the feelings of those who were not white and American. In Let\u2019s Do it, birds and bees replaces the \u201cJaps\u201d and \u201cChinks\u201d who had originally done it. There were other reasons for lyrical changes, too \u2013 such as Hollywood\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/mar/05/features3\">Hays Code</a>, which dictated what was acceptable in film. When Anything Goes was filmed in 1936, I Get a Kick Out of You had its lyrics changed, so rather than a single sniff of cocaine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkbcz3tebXE\">boring Ethel Merman terrifically</a>, it became perfume from Spain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9kgk3dtk1U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9kgk3dtk1U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Ethel Merman: I Get a Kick Out of You - video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>More intriguing, perhaps, are those instances where songwriters change the lyrics of songs to reflect the way they feel, rather than the way they want to be perceived. In 1978, having become a born-again Christian, Bob Dylan started changing the lyrics to Tangled Up in Blue, swapping the reference to \u201can Italian poet / From the 13th century\u201d to \u201cJeremiah Chapter 17 / From verses 21 and 33\u201d. On stage in Ohio in June 2016, Twenty One Pilots singer Tyler Joseph <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akEnJ3lGhl8\">altered the words</a> to his band\u2019s hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY\">Stressed Out</a>: instead of a plea for the ability to write something wholly original, it became an expression of feeling absolutely sick of singing it every night and hearing it everywhere: \u201cI wish I wrote a different song no one\u2019s ever heard / I wish my mom would just admit she\u2019s sick of every word / Overplayed, overstayed, it was a smash hit / Funny how overplayed songs sound like crap / I was told our true fans don\u2019t like this song / But I hope they sing along.\u201d</p> <p>My favourite altered lyric, though, is one of the least dramatic, least ostentatious. When <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNxTJYsegKU\">Jonathan Richman recorded Old World</a> with the Modern Lovers in 1972, it was in defiance of youth. Richman had no time for the druggy faddishness of the hippies, so focused on their own gratification at the expense of engaging with the world. \u201cI want to keep my place in the old world,\u201d he sang, \u201cKeep my place in the arcane / Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world.\u201d As he has aged, Richman has shed that reactive conservatism. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FtlFvcesTM\">He still plays Old World in concert</a> \u2013 unlike almost all the rest of the Modern Lovers\u2019 material \u2013 but now it is the sound of someone resisting the necrotising grasp of the past: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the old world / I don\u2019t want to go back to the 40s.\u201d There are still things he loves about the old world (varying on when you might happen to see him perform) \u2013 \u201cthe dignity and charm of it\u201d. But the old world represents \u201cmustard gas and women not being allowed to vote\u201d. He\u2019s happy, now, to live in the present.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/katy-perry-interview-witness-album-glastonbury\">\u2018I created this character called Katy Perry.

      "bodyText": "What a difference a decade makes. \u201cIf I had to write that song again, I probably would make an edit on it,\u201d Katy Perry recently told Glamour magazine of her 2009 breakthrough hit, I Kissed a Girl. \u201cLyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much. What\u2019s true for you can evolve.\u201d Given that I Kissed a Girl is little more than a piece of titillation \u2013 \u201cI hope my boyfriend don\u2019t mind it / It felt so wrong / It felt so right\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m not at all sure removing a couple of stereotypes from it would make much difference. And there was no mention from Perry of her contemporaneous and even more are-you-really-sure-you-want-to-go-there Ur So Gay. But the impulse is right, and one as old as song itself. Folk songs changed lyrics to fit geographical and temporal needs, or just because the lyrics got lost along the way in ages when they were not recorded on paper or on tape. The growth of recorded music, and of the mass market for music sales and performance, hastened the process. At one end of the spectrum are the lyric changes that seem halfhearted at best, a will-this-do shrug. Like the Rolling Stones altering the lyric of Stray Cat Blues in live performance, so Mick Jagger is no longer inviting a 15-year-old girl and her friend to have it off with him. \u201cIt\u2019s no hanging matter,\u201d he insists. \u201cIt\u2019s no capital crime.\u201d No, but it will get you a prison sentence and intense disapproval. So these days Jagger sings instead of a 16-year-old girl. Which, obviously, is not creepy and unpleasant at all. If one goes back to the 1920s and 30s, the array of songs whose lyrics changed to reflect changing sensibilities is eye-opening. Oscar Hammerstein\u2019s original lyrics for Ol\u2019 Man River made use of the N-word, but when Show Boat was filmed in 1936, nine years after the original Broadway production, that word had changed to become \u201cdarkies\u201d. A decade on, when it was revived on Broadway, that in turn changed to \u201ccoloured folks\u201d, and when Frank Sinatra sang it in the 1946 Jerome Kern biopic Till the Clouds Roll By, it wasn\u2019t even \u201ccoloured folks\u201d working \u201cwhile de white folks play\u201d \u2013 instead: \u201chere we all work\u201d. Cole Porter\u2019s songs, too, were made more sensitive to the feelings of those who were not white and American. In Let\u2019s Do it, birds and bees replaces the \u201cJaps\u201d and \u201cChinks\u201d who had originally done it. There were other reasons for lyrical changes, too \u2013 such as Hollywood\u2019s Hays Code, which dictated what was acceptable in film. When Anything Goes was filmed in 1936, I Get a Kick Out of You had its lyrics changed, so rather than a single sniff of cocaine boring Ethel Merman terrifically, it became perfume from Spain. More intriguing, perhaps, are those instances where songwriters change the lyrics of songs to reflect the way they feel, rather than the way they want to be perceived. In 1978, having become a born-again Christian, Bob Dylan started changing the lyrics to Tangled Up in Blue, swapping the reference to \u201can Italian poet / From the 13th century\u201d to \u201cJeremiah Chapter 17 / From verses 21 and 33\u201d. On stage in Ohio in June 2016, Twenty One Pilots singer Tyler Joseph altered the words to his band\u2019s hit Stressed Out: instead of a plea for the ability to write something wholly original, it became an expression of feeling absolutely sick of singing it every night and hearing it everywhere: \u201cI wish I wrote a different song no one\u2019s ever heard / I wish my mom would just admit she\u2019s sick of every word / Overplayed, overstayed, it was a smash hit / Funny how overplayed songs sound like crap / I was told our true fans don\u2019t like this song / But I hope they sing along.\u201d My favourite altered lyric, though, is one of the least dramatic, least ostentatious. When Jonathan Richman recorded Old World with the Modern Lovers in 1972, it was in defiance of youth. Richman had no time for the druggy faddishness of the hippies, so focused on their own gratification at the expense of engaging with the world. \u201cI want to keep my place in the old world,\u201d he sang, \u201cKeep my place in the arcane / Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world.\u201d As he has aged, Richman has shed that reactive conservatism. He still plays Old World in concert \u2013 unlike almost all the rest of the Modern Lovers\u2019 material \u2013 but now it is the sound of someone resisting the necrotising grasp of the past: \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to the old world / I don\u2019t want to go back to the 40s.\u201d There are still things he loves about the old world (varying on when you might happen to see him perform) \u2013 \u201cthe dignity and charm of it\u201d. But the old world represents \u201cmustard gas and women not being allowed to vote\u201d. He\u2019s happy, now, to live in the present. Which brings us back to Katy Perry. I Kissed a Girl was never meant to be profound. She may regret it now, but it\u2019s a pop song not an expression of her world view. It is cheap and tawdry and it trivialised queer sexuality. But it wasn\u2019t malicious or hateful, just condescending. Just write it off as a youthful folly and a lesson learned. Then, maybe 30 years from now, she can revisit it, like Richman, from a wholly different perspective, and see what comes out.",

Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/02/us-bond-market-rout-fears-trigger-wall-street-sell-off\">had reached 2.9%</a>. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there worse to come?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates.

Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is it a threat to the global economy?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">US economy</a>&nbsp;will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has signalled that an interest rate hike is coming from as early as May and that there are more to come, as the economy accelerates with help from booming global growth. Threadneedle Street said it would need to raise rates to tackle stubbornly high inflation \u201csomewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent\u201d than it had anticipated towards the end of last year. While the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to leave rates at 0.50% this month, the tone of its discussion suggests the cost of borrowing will not remain this low for much longer. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, had previously suggested there could be two further rate hikes to curb inflation over the next three years \u2013 but speculation will now mount over the chance of additional rate hikes. The pound rose on foreign exchanges following the interest rate decision, hitting almost \u00a31.40 against the dollar. City investors give a 75% chance of a rate hike in May, after having previously given a 50-50 probability. The FTSE 100 sold off sharply, falling by more than 108.7 points to below 7,200, amid a global stock market rout triggered by concerns among investors that central banks will need to raise interest rates faster than expected to curb rising inflation. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 400 points by lunchtime. Threadneedle Street said inflation would fall more gradually than it had previously anticipated, because workers\u2019 pay is slowly beginning to pick-up and as the oil prices is rising. \u201cThe outlook for growth and inflation [is] likely to require some ongoing withdrawal of monetary stimulus,\u201d the MPC said. Although the consumer price index reached 3.1% in November and is forecast to fall over the coming year as the effects of the weak pound following the Brexit vote begin to fade, the Bank said it is likely to remain above the 2% target. Writing to the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation was more than one percentage point outside the government\u2019s target, Carney said it was now \u201cappropriate to set monetary policy so that inflation returns sustainably to its target\u201d after previously having left the rate unchanged to support jobs and growth. A sustained upswing in global economic activity over the past year \u2013 led by the eurozone and stronger growth in the US and China \u2013 has helped to prevent a sharper Brexit-related slowdown in Britain. Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC and a former member of the MPC, warned that rates could rise up to three times this year as a result of inflationary pressures and global growth. \u201cAll this points to rising interest rates, both here in the UK and in other major economies.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is still likely that we will see at least one quarter point rise in 2018 and possibly two or three.\u201d Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown also said the drive to constrain inflation meant \u201crates could rise faster and further than investors had expected.\u201d Britain grew at its fastest rate in 2017 in the final quarter of the year, after a slump prompted by a slowdown in consumer spending earlier in the year, but is now forecast to rebound with the help of global trade. That is despite tough conditions for British households under intense pressure since the Brexit vote as the weak pound pushes up the cost of importing food and fuel. Brexit uncertainty has constrained the speed at which the UK can grow before prices begin to spiral, according to the Bank, which said the growth potential of the economy had been clipped below the levels it was able to achieve in previous years. Threadneedle Street reckons the annual supply capacity of the economy can only rise by about 1.5% before generating increased inflationary pressures, but estimates GDP growth will average about 1.75% each year until 2021. Worries over rising inflation have spooked financial markets in recent weeks, pushing up bond yields and triggering a sell-off in shares, as investors speculate how fast central banks will tighten monetary policy. Although most of the focus has been on the Federal Reserve and the arrival of its new chairman, Jerome Powell, the Bank\u2019s latest inflation report is likely to have fuelled fears in the City. The MPC said it was too early to gauge how large and persistent market corrections were likely to be. \u201cNotwithstanding recent volatility in financial markets, global financial conditions remain supportive,\u201d it added.",

Clearly, not even the most vociferous fan of the last band\u2019s oeuvre (Hitler\u2019s Knees, My Geraniums Are Bulletproof, Peter Smith Is a Banana, etc) would claim this as a recipe for success.

But first appearances are deceptive. Inside lurks music suggesting a dramatic rethink. Little Dark Age is audibly more rooted in mainstream mid-80s electronic pop than anything MGMT have recorded before: the title track is an uneasy take on the kind of super-smooth synth music that might once have cropped up on the soundtrack to Miami Vice, and One Thing Left To Try and TSLAMP reanimate a dreamily romantic Euro-pop sound.

So unless you\u2019ve got a Goan specialist nearby, if you want to try the real thing, your best bet is to make it at home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d603a5420853a49e495a5a61acddd4852d49fdfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d603a5420853a49e495a5a61acddd4852d49fdfc/526_135_2885_2885/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Madhur Jaffrey favours duck in her vindaloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s vindaloo uses poultry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The meat</h2> <p>The Portuguese have long been big on pig, making vindaloo one of the few Indian curries that\u2019s traditionally made with pork, though Lizzie Collingham notes in her fascinating historical survey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/aug/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview5\">Curry: A Biography</a>, that the British liked it better with duck \u2013 \u201cand so do I\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/madhur-jaffrey\">Madhur Jaffrey</a> also uses duck, noting that these \u201cpaddle freely in the thousands of flooded rice fields\u201d, and that using poultry allows Muslims and meat-eating Hindus to enjoy it, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/rickstein\">Rick Stein</a> makes his with shin of beef, \u201cbecause it matches the beef in India, which can be pretty tough\u201d (as well as relatively hard to come by, being a sacred beast to the country\u2019s Hindu majority), while chef <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/10/youve-got-to-be-pretty-ballsy-the-perils-of-cooking-when-your-other-halfs-a-restaurant-superstar\">Cyrus Todiwala</a> sticks with a mix of pork belly and shoulder, and Singh to pork leg, with a little of the bone left in for flavour.</p> <p>Collingham\u2019s duck breast and the pork leg prove the least popular among testers \u2013 principally, I think, because of their relative leanness, which makes them prone to dryness after a lengthy bath in vinegar. Richer or better-marbled meats, such as Jaffrey\u2019s duck leg or Stein\u2019s shin, work a lot better, though I\u2019m going to stay traditional and go for pork shoulder, which has enough marbling to remain juicy without the belly\u2019s large chunks of fat, which even a sauce as tangy as this can\u2019t quite cut through. If you must use chicken, go for thigh; lamb lovers will be well served by shoulder.</p> <p>Many recipes call for the meat to be marinated overnight, but the high vinegar content of the marinade makes this a risky business: the acetic acid can begin to \u201ccook\u201d the proteins in much the same way as citrus does in a ceviche, thereby rendering it tough. A few hours should do the job in the flavour department.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fac99f1e57ac74af86bf4bb18be1f2fac4571e91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fac99f1e57ac74af86bf4bb18be1f2fac4571e91/474_0_2933_2933/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Collingham\u2019s vindaloo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Collingham says the British liked Vindaloo better with duck \u2013 \u2018and so do I\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The masala</h2> <p>Whether or not you use it to marinate the meat before cooking, every curry begins with a masala, or spice mix \u2013 and in this instance chilli is not the principal ingredient. Though they all use slightly different combinations and amounts, all the recipes I try contain an array of what we might think of as sweet spices \u2013 cinnamon, cloves and cardamom \u2013 plus a hefty hit of black pepper, and the earthy, nutty flavours of cumin, coriander and turmeric. Chilli powder is generally added for colour, rather than heat, with Jaffrey recommending \u201cbright red paprika\u201d and Stein and Todiwala specifying Kashmiri chilli powder, sold under that name by Indian brands and remarkable for its brick-like hue. According to one Goan of my acquaintance, vindaloo is defined by its \u201cbeautiful, deep-red masala\u201d, so be liberal with the mild chilli for maximum authenticity. Jaffrey and Collingham also use mustard seeds, which win points both for their pleasing texture and the little pops of bitter warmth they release.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"236998a22439c3e7e7e1e6af3dd03d79c45a690a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236998a22439c3e7e7e1e6af3dd03d79c45a690a/0_0_4032_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Stein\u2019s vindaloo makes use of tamarind juice for tanginess.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Stein\u2019s vindaloo makes use of tamarind juice for tanginess.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The vinegar</h2> <p>Though the Portuguese would have originally used wine vinegar (or, some speculate, simply wine that had soured on the long voyage over), the dish was quickly adapted to the local palm vinegar, made from coconut toddy. Collingham notes that if you can get hold of it, \u201cit will add a particularly Goan flavour\u201d to the dish. I manage to source some coconut vinegar, probably made from coconut water, in an Indian grocers (many Oriental stockists may carry a Filipino brand), but as I\u2019m reliably informed, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to find the legit stuff outside the state of Goa, let alone abroad\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about hunting a bottle down. Singh uses a mixture of white and malt vinegar, and Stein white-wine vinegar, but the best substitute I find is Jaffrey\u2019s cider vinegar, which has similar sweet notes to the coconut variety.</p> <p>Todiwala, Stein and Collingham also add tamarind liquid, which is fruitier and less sharp than vinegar, and gives the dish a more rounded, less mouth-puckeringly acidic sour quality. I\u2019m with Stein when he says that ready-made tamarind liquids seem to lack the punch of freshly soaked stuff; it\u2019s not hard to prepare, after all.</p> <h2>The vegetables</h2> <p>Todiwala describes the dish as \u201ca sort of meaty pickle, rich and intense in flavour\u201d, which may explain the extraordinary number of onions in his recipe \u2013 but, in fact, their sweetness works brilliantly with the tangy vinegar and rich, slightly fatty meat. Much as I dislike chopping the things, it\u2019s worthwhile labour here, especially if you can find the sweeter Indian pink onion; otherwise, yellow ones will work fine. Liberal amounts of garlic and ginger add to the chutney-like effect: rather than crushing them to a paste, however, slice them into thin rounds and strips as Singh suggests, so they don\u2019t get lost in the whole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78eca9176c6df7285c863f03f929e74477ed705a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78eca9176c6df7285c863f03f929e74477ed705a/652_278_2511_2511/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cyrus Todiwala\u2019s vindaloo uses Kashmiri chilli powder \u2013 for colour, rather than heat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyrus Todiwala\u2019s vindaloo uses Kashmiri chilli powder \u2013 for colour, rather than heat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not everyone uses tomatoes, though their sweet and sour flavour seems a perfect fit, and they add a welcome touch of freshness, as do the green chillies most recipes stick in. If you like your curries hot, then feel free to mince them, but I prefer to add them whole, for a milder effect \u2013 remember to warn fellow diners about them, unless a younger sibling is coming round for dinner, in which case tell them they\u2019re green peppers.</p> <p>Jaffrey, Collingham and Todiwala\u2019s recipes all call for curry leaves, a highly aromatic herb that\u2019s particularly popular in south India. They\u2019re hard to come by here if you don\u2019t have an Indian specialist nearby, though you may find them in larger supermarkets \u2013 if you do, snap them up, because they freeze pretty well, and will lend your dish a bright herbaceous flavour.</p> <h2>Finishing touches</h2> <p>Todiwala is of the belief that a vindaloo should be \u201csweet from the palm sugar, sour from the vinegar, and hot\u201d \u2013 so don\u2019t be shy to temper the sourness with a good spoonful of jaggery or soft brown sugar if you can\u2019t find any.

      "bodyText": "The peculiar place of vindaloo, a fierily fragrant speciality of Goa in popular culture can be summed up by the 1998 World Cup football anthem of the same name, whose irritatingly catchy chorus references the curry no fewer than 11 times. As the Observer pointed out, its authors, the \u201cprank art collective\u201d Fat Les, \u201cpersuaded, among others, a lot of xenophobic, racist Little England football supporters to celebrate an item of Indian cuisine as a quintessential expression of Englishness\u201d. This is despite Goa having been a former Portuguese colony and one of the few parts of India that never saw British rule. Yet the vindaloo with which most Brits are most familiar \u2013 the hottest rung on the generic korma, tikka masala, madras ladder \u2013 bears little resemblance to the aromatic, pickle-sour original. Dan Toombs, author of The Curry Guy, dubs them \u201ceight-pint vindaloos\u201d, after the amount of lager needed to finish one. As chef Vivek Singh observes, though vindaloo is probably one of the best- known Indian dishes, \u201cit\u2019s also one of the most misunderstood\u201d. Thought to be a corruption of the Portuguese carne de vinha d\u2019alhos, or meat cooked in wine vinegar and garlic, an authentic, tangy vindaloo tingles the tongue with pepper, clove and other spices, rather than the one-dimensional heat of chilli powder. So unless you\u2019ve got a Goan specialist nearby, if you want to try the real thing, your best bet is to make it at home. The meat The Portuguese have long been big on pig, making vindaloo one of the few Indian curries that\u2019s traditionally made with pork, though Lizzie Collingham notes in her fascinating historical survey, Curry: A Biography, that the British liked it better with duck \u2013 \u201cand so do I\u201d. Madhur Jaffrey also uses duck, noting that these \u201cpaddle freely in the thousands of flooded rice fields\u201d, and that using poultry allows Muslims and meat-eating Hindus to enjoy it, too. Rick Stein makes his with shin of beef, \u201cbecause it matches the beef in India, which can be pretty tough\u201d (as well as relatively hard to come by, being a sacred beast to the country\u2019s Hindu majority), while chef Cyrus Todiwala sticks with a mix of pork belly and shoulder, and Singh to pork leg, with a little of the bone left in for flavour. Collingham\u2019s duck breast and the pork leg prove the least popular among testers \u2013 principally, I think, because of their relative leanness, which makes them prone to dryness after a lengthy bath in vinegar. Richer or better-marbled meats, such as Jaffrey\u2019s duck leg or Stein\u2019s shin, work a lot better, though I\u2019m going to stay traditional and go for pork shoulder, which has enough marbling to remain juicy without the belly\u2019s large chunks of fat, which even a sauce as tangy as this can\u2019t quite cut through. If you must use chicken, go for thigh; lamb lovers will be well served by shoulder. Many recipes call for the meat to be marinated overnight, but the high vinegar content of the marinade makes this a risky business: the acetic acid can begin to \u201ccook\u201d the proteins in much the same way as citrus does in a ceviche, thereby rendering it tough. A few hours should do the job in the flavour department. The masala Whether or not you use it to marinate the meat before cooking, every curry begins with a masala, or spice mix \u2013 and in this instance chilli is not the principal ingredient. Though they all use slightly different combinations and amounts, all the recipes I try contain an array of what we might think of as sweet spices \u2013 cinnamon, cloves and cardamom \u2013 plus a hefty hit of black pepper, and the earthy, nutty flavours of cumin, coriander and turmeric. Chilli powder is generally added for colour, rather than heat, with Jaffrey recommending \u201cbright red paprika\u201d and Stein and Todiwala specifying Kashmiri chilli powder, sold under that name by Indian brands and remarkable for its brick-like hue. According to one Goan of my acquaintance, vindaloo is defined by its \u201cbeautiful, deep-red masala\u201d, so be liberal with the mild chilli for maximum authenticity. Jaffrey and Collingham also use mustard seeds, which win points both for their pleasing texture and the little pops of bitter warmth they release. The vinegar Though the Portuguese would have originally used wine vinegar (or, some speculate, simply wine that had soured on the long voyage over), the dish was quickly adapted to the local palm vinegar, made from coconut toddy. Collingham notes that if you can get hold of it, \u201cit will add a particularly Goan flavour\u201d to the dish. I manage to source some coconut vinegar, probably made from coconut water, in an Indian grocers (many Oriental stockists may carry a Filipino brand), but as I\u2019m reliably informed, \u201cit\u2019s really hard to find the legit stuff outside the state of Goa, let alone abroad\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about hunting a bottle down. Singh uses a mixture of white and malt vinegar, and Stein white-wine vinegar, but the best substitute I find is Jaffrey\u2019s cider vinegar, which has similar sweet notes to the coconut variety. Todiwala, Stein and Collingham also add tamarind liquid, which is fruitier and less sharp than vinegar, and gives the dish a more rounded, less mouth-puckeringly acidic sour quality. I\u2019m with Stein when he says that ready-made tamarind liquids seem to lack the punch of freshly soaked stuff; it\u2019s not hard to prepare, after all. The vegetables Todiwala describes the dish as \u201ca sort of meaty pickle, rich and intense in flavour\u201d, which may explain the extraordinary number of onions in his recipe \u2013 but, in fact, their sweetness works brilliantly with the tangy vinegar and rich, slightly fatty meat. Much as I dislike chopping the things, it\u2019s worthwhile labour here, especially if you can find the sweeter Indian pink onion; otherwise, yellow ones will work fine. Liberal amounts of garlic and ginger add to the chutney-like effect: rather than crushing them to a paste, however, slice them into thin rounds and strips as Singh suggests, so they don\u2019t get lost in the whole. Not everyone uses tomatoes, though their sweet and sour flavour seems a perfect fit, and they add a welcome touch of freshness, as do the green chillies most recipes stick in. If you like your curries hot, then feel free to mince them, but I prefer to add them whole, for a milder effect \u2013 remember to warn fellow diners about them, unless a younger sibling is coming round for dinner, in which case tell them they\u2019re green peppers. Jaffrey, Collingham and Todiwala\u2019s recipes all call for curry leaves, a highly aromatic herb that\u2019s particularly popular in south India. They\u2019re hard to come by here if you don\u2019t have an Indian specialist nearby, though you may find them in larger supermarkets \u2013 if you do, snap them up, because they freeze pretty well, and will lend your dish a bright herbaceous flavour. Finishing touches Todiwala is of the belief that a vindaloo should be \u201csweet from the palm sugar, sour from the vinegar, and hot\u201d \u2013 so don\u2019t be shy to temper the sourness with a good spoonful of jaggery or soft brown sugar if you can\u2019t find any. Season to taste and serve with something plain: basmati, pillowy flatbreads or, Jaffrey\u2019s favourite, boiled potatoes and bitter greens. Lager strictly optional. The perfect vindaloo Prep 15-20 min Cook 2 hrs Serves 4-6 75ml cider vinegar 700g pork shoulder, cut into 3cm chunks 4 tbsp ghee, neutral or coconut oil 500g onions, finely sliced (about 4 medium onions) 60g tamarind pulp 10 garlic cloves, finely sliced 5cm thick length of ginger, cut into slim matchsticks 4 ripe tomatoes, diced 2-4 small green chillies 10 curry leaves (optional) 1 tbsp jaggery or soft brown sugar 1 tsp salt 1 tsp black mustard seeds For the masala 2 tbsp Kashmiri chilli powder or paprika Seeds of 8 cardamom pods 1 tsp black peppercorns 8 cloves 1 tsp cumin seeds \u00bd tsp coriander seeds \u00bd tsp turmeric 5cm cinnamon stick Grind together all the ingredients for the masala, then stir in the vinegar. Rub into the pork and leave to sit for three to four hours. Heat the oil in a wide, lidded pan over a medium-low flame, and fry the onions until soft and golden. Meanwhile, soak the tamarind pulp in 120ml of hot water for 15 minutes, then gently rub any remaining pulp from the seeds and strain off the liquid, discarding the solids. Stir the garlic and ginger into the onions and cook, stirring, for another five minutes, then add the tomatoes, chillies and curry leaves, if using, and cook until the tomatoes start to break down. Add the pork and marinade to the pan and turn the heat up to medium high. Stir well, add the jaggery, salt and mustard seeds, followed by the tamarind liquid. Bring to a simmer, cover tightly, turn the heat right down and cook gently for an hour. Partially remove the lid and cook for another 30 minutes, until the meat is very tender and the sauce has thickened. \u2022 Vindaloo, vindaloo: why does this Goan curry have such an iconic place in British culture, and where did the classic curry house version come from if not Goa?

The previous night\u2019s assignation to see a French movie has left him feeling needy enough to press his date on her reaction. He has to know how much she enjoyed their night out, detail by detail. <br></p> <p>Jarvis Cocker, who has a way with words, claims everything in <strong>Pulp</strong>\u2019s Disco 2000 is true except for the woodchip wallpaper. It\u2019s the story of his childhood friendship with Deborah Bone. Deborah was popular with the boys, and though he was crazy about her, he was doomed only to be her friend. So he had the idea of suggesting they meet again in the year 2000 so they could see each other as adults, and hopefully dredge up some adult emotions. He even nominated a time and a place. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/02/deborah-bone-dies-mental-health-pulp-disco-2000-mbe\">She died aged 51</a>, but Cocker did sing their song at her 50th birthday party.</p> <p>Mike Skinner, another wordsmith, spins a cautionary tale in the <strong>Streets</strong>\u2019 It\u2019s Too Late. Despite his deep feelings for his girl, Skinner\u2019s protagonist lacks the motivation to arrive at their rendezvous at the designated time. Repeatedly, he comes up with lame excuses about having to see a mate or a dealer. He has a conscience about this behaviour and eventually resolves to be more reliable. But the day he turns up on time, new leaf turned \u2013 she\u2019s not there.</p> <p>Like many an old blues song, John Lee Hooker and <strong>Canned Heat</strong>\u2019s Meet Me in the Bottom has been recorded dozens of times by dozens of artists. Each recording has produced slight variations on the musical and lyrical themes. But the core of the song has always been maintained: we have a man on the run, scared for his life. Whether facing a lynch mob or a posse, he has to move quickly, so fast that he flees barefoot. He\u2019ll be hiding down in the bottom, he says, where his woman will bring him his boots and shoes.</p> <p>A junk-sick \u201cwhite boy\u201d is forced by his need to traipse up to Harlem and wait for a dealer to turn up in the <strong>Velvet Underground</strong>\u2019s I\u2019m Waiting for the Man. \u201cHe\u2019s never early, he\u2019s always late / First thing you learn is you always got to wait.\u201d Harassed by suspicious locals, he has to stay rooted to the spot until his man turns up. He is taken to a room full of strangers, scores, goes home, gets grief from his wife, then looks forward to doing it all again the next day.</p> <p>Another kind of illicit rendezvous lies at the heart of <strong>Frank Zappa</strong>\u2019s Willie the Pimp. A thumbnail sketch of a player at the centre of Hollywood\u2019s Lido Hotel maelstrom, Willie (Captain Beefheart) barks his wares and arranges meetings between besuited businessmen and his waiting floozies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/matthew.holmes.guardian/playlist/1Qsu6gEWFhnfX2ZWqGvBvy\"> <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/matthew.holmes.guardian/playlist/1Qsu6gEWFhnfX2ZWqGvBvy\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Is this about dogging? For me <strong>Richard Hawley</strong>\u2019s Down in the Woods conjures up images of Lynx-lacquered lorry-drivers lasciviously looking on as string-vested accountants take their wives in the glare of headlamps across a hot bonnet. Well, at least their bottoms are kept warm.</p> <p>In deeply immoral mode, <strong>Clarence Carter</strong>, in his Slip Away, beseeches a presumably married woman to slip out of the house without her husband knowing she\u2019s gone. He wants to take her to a place where they\u2019re both unknown. Sometimes the most beautiful music tells the wickedest of tales.</p> <p>Speaking of which, the protagonist in the <strong>Incredible String Band</strong>\u2019s Saturday Maybe makes Alfie Elkins look like the Archbishop of Canterbury. A typical back-door man, his squalid assignation is related in monochrome images as he explains it\u2019s just a quickie before her husband gets back from the boozer. He suggests a rendezvous, though is uncertain what day that might be.

British electronic duo Basement Jaxx don\u2019t mince words in their rather persistent call to Rendez-Vu: \u201cI got you in my heart / I got you in my head / Let\u2019s make a rendez-vu.\u201d Manu Chao, on the other hand, needs a ton of reassurance in his Le Rendez-Vous. The previous night\u2019s assignation to see a French movie has left him feeling needy enough to press his date on her reaction. He has to know how much she enjoyed their night out, detail by detail. Jarvis Cocker, who has a way with words, claims everything in Pulp\u2019s Disco 2000 is true except for the woodchip wallpaper. It\u2019s the story of his childhood friendship with Deborah Bone. Deborah was popular with the boys, and though he was crazy about her, he was doomed only to be her friend. So he had the idea of suggesting they meet again in the year 2000 so they could see each other as adults, and hopefully dredge up some adult emotions. He even nominated a time and a place. She died aged 51, but Cocker did sing their song at her 50th birthday party. Mike Skinner, another wordsmith, spins a cautionary tale in the Streets\u2019 It\u2019s Too Late. Despite his deep feelings for his girl, Skinner\u2019s protagonist lacks the motivation to arrive at their rendezvous at the designated time. Repeatedly, he comes up with lame excuses about having to see a mate or a dealer. He has a conscience about this behaviour and eventually resolves to be more reliable. But the day he turns up on time, new leaf turned \u2013 she\u2019s not there. Like many an old blues song, John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat\u2019s Meet Me in the Bottom has been recorded dozens of times by dozens of artists. Each recording has produced slight variations on the musical and lyrical themes. But the core of the song has always been maintained: we have a man on the run, scared for his life. Whether facing a lynch mob or a posse, he has to move quickly, so fast that he flees barefoot. He\u2019ll be hiding down in the bottom, he says, where his woman will bring him his boots and shoes. A junk-sick \u201cwhite boy\u201d is forced by his need to traipse up to Harlem and wait for a dealer to turn up in the Velvet Underground\u2019s I\u2019m Waiting for the Man. \u201cHe\u2019s never early, he\u2019s always late / First thing you learn is you always got to wait.\u201d Harassed by suspicious locals, he has to stay rooted to the spot until his man turns up. He is taken to a room full of strangers, scores, goes home, gets grief from his wife, then looks forward to doing it all again the next day. Another kind of illicit rendezvous lies at the heart of Frank Zappa\u2019s Willie the Pimp. A thumbnail sketch of a player at the centre of Hollywood\u2019s Lido Hotel maelstrom, Willie (Captain Beefheart) barks his wares and arranges meetings between besuited businessmen and his waiting floozies. Is this about dogging? For me Richard Hawley\u2019s Down in the Woods conjures up images of Lynx-lacquered lorry-drivers lasciviously looking on as string-vested accountants take their wives in the glare of headlamps across a hot bonnet. Well, at least their bottoms are kept warm. In deeply immoral mode, Clarence Carter, in his Slip Away, beseeches a presumably married woman to slip out of the house without her husband knowing she\u2019s gone. He wants to take her to a place where they\u2019re both unknown. Sometimes the most beautiful music tells the wickedest of tales. Speaking of which, the protagonist in the Incredible String Band\u2019s Saturday Maybe makes Alfie Elkins look like the Archbishop of Canterbury. A typical back-door man, his squalid assignation is related in monochrome images as he explains it\u2019s just a quickie before her husband gets back from the boozer. He suggests a rendezvous, though is uncertain what day that might be. Then he asks her not to cry because she\u2019ll freak out the baby! New theme: how to join in The next theme will be announced at 8pm (GMT) on Thursday 8 February. You will have until 11pm on Monday 12 February to submit nominations. Here is a reminder of some of the guidelines for readers recommend: If you have a good idea for a theme, or you would like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions and write a blog about it, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com. There is a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the new look Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d, \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog.",

But in the end they probably pay more attention to the electoral maths. Around two-thirds of Tory MPs voted to remain in the EU, but more than 60% of the party\u2019s members and supporters voted to leave. An even larger proportion of Labour MPs, around 95%, are remainers, while more than 60% of party members and current supporters back remain. But the MPs are very aware that two-thirds of Labour constituencies voted leave and <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/\" title=\"\">more than 60%</a> of their traditional support base \u2013 <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/c2de\" title=\"\">C2DE</a> working-class voters \u2013 backed leaving.</p> <p>But as Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has pointed out, we are nearing the point where firm proposals have to be put forward.

The party now says it will review the position on the customs union, though the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell remains wary of a backlash among its northern and Midlands voters should there be a change. But are these fears justified?</p> <p>Like 40% or so of Labour voters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/22/remain-reform-wishful-thinking-left-vote-leave\" title=\"\">I voted to leave</a>, fed up with domestic austerity, EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/eu.creditcrunch\" title=\"\">rules on government deficit and national debt ratios</a>, and the EU\u2019s decade of mass unemployment to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/10/austerity-europe-debt-red-cross\" title=\"\">shore up the euro and the banks</a>. Many hard remainers in Labour put staying in the EU above all other considerations. But many Labour people will still put dealing with Britain\u2019s inequality, growing poverty and the marginalisation of so many people in the old industrial areas (which mostly voted leave) as their top priority. And that means toppling this paralysed Tory government and electing a Labour government that will enact the radical policies to transform this situation, whether or not they clash with what the EU would prefer.</p> <p>That\u2019s easier said than done, but maybe now is the time to be brave and put the Tories on the spot by backing staying in the EU customs union. That has several pluses. It sorts out the Irish border problem and avoids huge tailbacks at Dover and other ports; there need be no disruption of supply chains for the car and other industries; and it spikes the neoliberals\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/24/singapore-on-thames-post-brexit-britain-wealthy-city-state\" title=\"\">Singapore option</a> \u2013 a deregulated, free-trading billionaires\u2019 playground (which is why the Tory hard Brexiters are so opposed).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/24/singapore-on-thames-post-brexit-britain-wealthy-city-state\">Singapore-on-Thames? This is no vision for post-Brexit Britain | Jeevan Vasagar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s also a policy that could bring together a large part of the country, whether they voted leave or remain. In <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm\" title=\"\">1975 Britain voted two to one to stay in the European Economic Community</a> \u2013 essentially a customs union. It\u2019s the over-regulation required by the single market and the political ambitions of the EU after Maastricht that rile people. Of course that would mean being firmer about leaving an unreformed single market. But the policy of the Labour hard remainers of staying in the EU while pretending we haven\u2019t \u2013 staying in the single market, with free movement, large budget contributions and European court jurisdiction \u2013 fools no one.</p> <p>Up to now, the Tories have been able to sideline rebellions from their own remain contingent (Ken Clarke, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/06/tories-anna-soubry-brexiters-jacob-rees-mogg-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Anna Soubry</a>, Dominic Grieve and so on) by abstaining on Labour motions where defeat looked likely, such as on a final parliamentary vote on any deal. But it\u2019s hard to see how they could abstain on such a major issue as the customs union. And while the DUP MPs who prop up the Tories are leavers, above all else they do not want a physical border in Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</p> <p>The Labour leadership has been right to hedge its bets and let Tory divisions fester when it has no role in the negotiations with the EU. But it too has to make up its mind on the future direction. It could declare its support for staying in the customs union, but back it up by reaching out (as it has so far failed to do) to Walsall and Stoke and Mansfield, and all the other deprived leave-voting areas, with a new-deal plan of investment in infrastructure, training and jobs. Now may be the time for Labour to take a risk, strike out and leave the Tories floundering.</p> <p>\u2022 Nigel Willmott is the Guardian\u2019s letters editor</p>",

Around two-thirds of Tory MPs voted to remain in the EU, but more than 60% of the party\u2019s members and supporters voted to leave. An even larger proportion of Labour MPs, around 95%, are remainers, while more than 60% of party members and current supporters back remain. But the MPs are very aware that two-thirds of Labour constituencies voted leave and more than 60% of their traditional support base \u2013 C2DE working-class voters \u2013 backed leaving. But as Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has pointed out, we are nearing the point where firm proposals have to be put forward. The most immediate crunch point is the question of the customs union \u2013 a tariff-free area that allows goods to cross borders painlessly. With a bespoke \u201ccustoms partnership\u201d based on virtual borders little more than a figment of some speechwriter\u2019s imagination, the divide within the government over the issue looks to be unbridgeable. Labour\u2019s official position at the moment is also that the UK will leave both the customs union and the single market, replacing them with participation in \u201ca customs union\u201d and \u201ca single market\u201d ... angels dancing on the heads of pins. The party now says it will review the position on the customs union, though the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell remains wary of a backlash among its northern and Midlands voters should there be a change. But are these fears justified? Like 40% or so of Labour voters, I voted to leave, fed up with domestic austerity, EU rules on government deficit and national debt ratios, and the EU\u2019s decade of mass unemployment to shore up the euro and the banks. Many hard remainers in Labour put staying in the EU above all other considerations. But many Labour people will still put dealing with Britain\u2019s inequality, growing poverty and the marginalisation of so many people in the old industrial areas (which mostly voted leave) as their top priority. And that means toppling this paralysed Tory government and electing a Labour government that will enact the radical policies to transform this situation, whether or not they clash with what the EU would prefer. That\u2019s easier said than done, but maybe now is the time to be brave and put the Tories on the spot by backing staying in the EU customs union. That has several pluses. It sorts out the Irish border problem and avoids huge tailbacks at Dover and other ports; there need be no disruption of supply chains for the car and other industries; and it spikes the neoliberals\u2019 Singapore option \u2013 a deregulated, free-trading billionaires\u2019 playground (which is why the Tory hard Brexiters are so opposed). It\u2019s also a policy that could bring together a large part of the country, whether they voted leave or remain. In 1975 Britain voted two to one to stay in the European Economic Community \u2013 essentially a customs union. It\u2019s the over-regulation required by the single market and the political ambitions of the EU after Maastricht that rile people. Of course that would mean being firmer about leaving an unreformed single market. But the policy of the Labour hard remainers of staying in the EU while pretending we haven\u2019t \u2013 staying in the single market, with free movement, large budget contributions and European court jurisdiction \u2013 fools no one. Up to now, the Tories have been able to sideline rebellions from their own remain contingent (Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve and so on) by abstaining on Labour motions where defeat looked likely, such as on a final parliamentary vote on any deal. But it\u2019s hard to see how they could abstain on such a major issue as the customs union. And while the DUP MPs who prop up the Tories are leavers, above all else they do not want a physical border in Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Labour leadership has been right to hedge its bets and let Tory divisions fester when it has no role in the negotiations with the EU. But it too has to make up its mind on the future direction. It could declare its support for staying in the customs union, but back it up by reaching out (as it has so far failed to do) to Walsall and Stoke and Mansfield, and all the other deprived leave-voting areas, with a new-deal plan of investment in infrastructure, training and jobs. Now may be the time for Labour to take a risk, strike out and leave the Tories floundering. \u2022 Nigel Willmott is the Guardian\u2019s letters editor",

Although I have some quarrels with the production, it is refreshing to hear Dryden\u2019s rhyming couplets, which bounce off the walls like a ball in a squash court. </p> <p>The big question is how you present to a modern audience a heroic drama set in 1660s India, dealing with the succession crisis in the Mughal dynasty. Rutter\u2019s answer is to set the action in the dyeing shop of a mill in northern England, whose Asian workers turn into historical figures. But although we initially see the actors clocking on and assuming brightly coloured robes, little is made of the contrast between their humble daily routines and the power-hungry characters they play. And while Rutter puts three musicians on stage to play Niraj Chag\u2019s music, for long periods they are left to be silent spectators. </p> <p>What does come across is the flexibility of Dryden\u2019s rhymes, which encompass bombast, pathos and comedy. The plot hinges on the fact that a succession of men are driven wild by the intoxicating beauty of the captive queen, Indamora. She is loved by her protector, Aurangzeb, and lustfully pursued by his old dad, the Mughal emperor. But she also captivates the emperor\u2019s younger son, the militant Morat, and Agra\u2019s aged governor, Arimant. Dryden wittily suggests, however, that Indamora is well equipped to handle the situation. Skilfully keeping the panting Arimant at bay, she tells him: \u201cKnowing what power I have your will to bend, I\u2019ll use it \u2013 for I need just such a friend.\u201d</p> <p>The play is at its best in the comic scenes, especially those where Rutter as the errant emperor confronts his fiery wife, Nourmahal, whom Angela Griffin plays in a fine lather of indignation. The essayist Joseph Addison complained that if you stripped the husband-wife spats of their shining words, the sentiments would be \u201ctoo coarse for a scene in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/jul/22/billingsgate-fish-market\">Billingsgate</a>\u201d. But that seems to me the whole point. When Rutter\u2019s emperor says of his fast-approaching spouse \u201cIf I but hear her named, I\u2019m sick that day\u201d, we are not that far from the misogynistic disgruntlement of Les Dawson. </p> <p>It is much harder to get worked up over the dynastic power battles, and there were times when I wished the actors embraced the rhetoric more fully.

Among the musicians there are striking vocal ululations from Nawazish Ali Khan and, thanks to candle consultant Paul Russell, the action in this space is for once fully visible. But glad as I am to have caught this rare old piece, I longed to see the actors returning to their shop-floor jobs having escaped into the luxuriant role of Mughal potentates.

      "bodyText": "John Cena is a man of many talents. He can wrestle. He can rap. He can play the piano. He can do the voice of cartoon bulls. And now, inevitably, he can write. Cena\u2019s first children\u2019s book \u2013 Elbow Grease, a story about a plucky monster truck \u2013 will be published by Random House in October. But he is not alone in the endeavour. Lupita Nyongo has just signed up to write a children\u2019s book called Sulwe, about a Kenyan girl who discovers the truth about beauty during a whimsical adventure in the sky. Of course, this is no surprise, since celebrities have always been weirdly talented when it comes to writing books for children. John, Lupita, meet your new peers. Jay Leno: If Roast Beef Could Fly (2004) Premise Little Jay\u2019s extravagant father barbecues a slab of roast beef, but Little Jay wants it all to himself. Will it backfire with hilarious consequences? Well, \u2018hilarious\u2019 is a strong word. Cover A genuinely nightmarish cartoon of Jay Leno\u2019s adult head grafted on to a child\u2019s body, wearing a shirt and tie like an adult. Really disturbing. Horrific. Sample Amazon review \u201cWhile this is a loving family story, it contains some stereotypes about national origin.\u201d Perez Hilton: The Boy With Pink Hair (2011) Premise A boy is born with pink hair, and struggles because people are mean. Written by the author of headlines like \u201cSkanky O\u2019Day Needs Less Skank In Her Milkshake\u201d and \u201cWatch Perez Eat a Dirty Tampon\u201d. Cover A boy with pink hair, obviously. Sample Amazon review \u201cIt makes me ill to think of Perez Hilton (of all people) writing a children\u2019s book. He has the morals of a fruit fly.\u201d John Travolta: Propeller One-Way Night Coach: A Fable for All Ages (1997) Premise When Jeff\u2019s mother decides to move to Hollywood, he enters a magical world of \u2018connecting flights, airline food, stopovers, and time spent in first class\u2019. Look, John, you like planes. We get it. Cover Stars and a couple of planes. Looks like the sort of thing you doodle on pads during boring phone calls. Sample Amazon review \u201cI would not classify this book as a fable for all ages.\u201d Sting: Rock Steady (2001) Premise A hip young couple read an advert looking for people to go a great adventure. Guess what that adventure is? It\u2019s literally Noah\u2019s Ark. Sting wrote a book about Noah\u2019s Ark. Cover A bright, bold, two-dimensional drawing of Noah and an ark, by the illustrator High Whyte. Sample Amazon review \u201cIt\u2019s Sting. It\u2019s Noah\u2019s funky Arc. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Jamie Lee Curtis: Is There Really a Human Race? (2006) Premise If the human race is an actual physical race, then what sort of race is it? An obstacle course? A zillion-yard dash? A horse race? If it\u2019s a horse race, are we the horse or the jockey? Spoiler: it\u2019s a relay race, because life is finite and soon we will all be dead. Cover A boy hugging the entire planet. Sample Amazon review \u201cJamie Lee is very clever with her wordings and rhymes.\u201d Joy Behar: Sheetzucacapoopoo: My Kind of Dog (2006) Premise Max is a mixed-breed dog who has trouble integrating with the purebreds. An important book on race, albeit one with a title that\u2019s essentially three different terms for feces stitched together. Cover A happy dog with a droopy tongue. Sample Amazon review \u201cMaybe it\u2019s me, but I just don\u2019t like how Ms. Behar keeps portraying every single dog but her own as being prejudiced. Prejudice usually stems from something, for example fear and/or ignorance; It doesn\u2019t just pop out of thin air one morning at breakfast. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no rhyme or reason for the dogs\u2019 dislike of each other in this book other than the author wants to beat her message over the heads of the readers in case they didn\u2019t know that \u2018racism is stupid\u2019. For goodness sake, a chihuahua mix refused to play with Max because he didn\u2019t have triangle ears! And another only liked dogs with long straight hair. So these dogs are highschool cliques now?\u201d Spike Lee: Please, Baby, Please (2007) Premise Arguably less provocative than his film output, Please, Baby, Please tells a nice story oabout two tired parents who keep begging a toddler to be nice over and over again. In the end, the toddler is left begging her parents for a tangible display of affection, so who\u2019s laughing now? Cover A toddler surrounded by unspooled toilet roll, looking like trouble. Sample Amazon review \u201cAs many other reviews have pointed out, the baby is treated as a nuisance all day long. I would have killed to see one page where baby got some positive reinforcement. And what baby doesn\u2019t get up too early or walk too slow? Mama needs a chill pill.\u201d Kelly Clarkson: River Rose and the Magical Christmas (2017) Premise Kelly Clarkson\u2019s daughter falls asleep and somehow gets shanghaied into some sort of adventure with Santa Claus. The moral here seems to be: never fall asleep, kids. Cover A girl flies around the moon, accompanied by Santa Claus. Butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. Sample Amazon review \u201cI love Kelly Clarkson so when I heard she was putting out a second book I bought it.\u201d Bill Cosby: The Day I Was Rich (1999) Premise Little Bill finds a giant diamond and wonders how he\u2019ll spend his newfound fortune. Sadly, the diamond turns out to be a glass paperweight, because everything will break your heart in the end. Cover Little Bill holding a diamond in the air to the delight of three girls. Sample Amazon review \u201cBill Cosby writes this book for all to learn to laugh at ourself once in a while!\u201d",

Free services make money by profiling users for advertising purposes. Coppa requires verified parental consent (VPC) for the collection of personal information about children under 13. It\u2019s simpler and cheaper for services to ban under 13s, and remove any it finds, than to obtain that consent. Instagram has a <a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/contact/723586364339719?helpref=faq_content\">removal form</a>.</p> <p>The European Union, which strives for better privacy protection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/15/europe-ban-teenagers-facebook-internet-data-protection-under-16\">tried to increase the age requirement to 16</a>. However, after lobbying, the EU decided to allow individual countries to set their own age of consent and, as you would expect, the UK opted out. As a result, the UK is governed by the American law as implemented by Facebook, Instagram and the rest.</p> <p>These companies would make no profit from losing a legal user, and removing your son\u2019s accounts would incur a cost. You can guess how likely that is.</p> <p>Talking to you or answering your questions would incur a much greater cost, so that\u2019s not likely either.</p> <p>If you have 2.13 billion active users \u2013 which Facebook does \u2013 and 10% of them have one question per year, you would need to hire enough staff to answer 4mquestions a week.

Nowadays many children use WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, SnapChat, WeChat, Kik, and Ask.fm. Some may use Viber, Line or even <a href=\"http://www.imqq.com/English1033.html\">QQ</a>. Most use YouTube. There are also lots of <a href=\"https://alternativeto.net/software/gmail/\">free alternatives to Gmail</a>.</p> <p>Even if you control his phone, your son may be able to access services via other devices such as PCs and tablets, either at home or at friends\u2019 houses. In most cases, he can set up new accounts using any fake name or pseudonym he wants, a made-up birthday, and other spurious details. Few sites apart from Facebook try to enforce a <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/help/112146705538576?helpref=faq_content\">real names policy</a>.</p> <p>Few free sites have a way of checking someone\u2019s age, and asking for a credit card number or government-backed ID would just stop people from signing up. Amusingly, the domain name that the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) suggested to \u201cstay informed about <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/487973/ukccis_guide-final__3_.pdf\">the development of a public standard for age verification</a> by the British Standards Institute\u201d \u2013 http://www.agecheckstandard.com \u2013 is currently <a href=\"https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=agecheckstandard&amp;e=com\">for sale for $1,795</a>.</p> <h2>Network blocking</h2> <p>An alternative sanction would be to block access to sites that you don\u2019t want your son to use.</p> <p>Most British internet service providers offer age-related filtering services, which are supposed to stop under 18s from seeing harmful content. Mobile network operators also provide filtering, and the largest UK networks may apply it by default to new phones. You usually have to be an age-verified adult bill payer to change this.</p> <p>The Open Rights Group\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.blocked.org.uk/\">Blocked</a> website says it has detected more than 600,000 sites that have been blocked by one or more of BT, Virgin, Sky, Vodafone, EE and O2. Many are ridiculous, including <a href=\"http://www.classicfm.com/\">ClassicFM</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.csp.org.uk/\">Chartered Society of Physiotherapy</a>.</p> <p>Unreliable as their filtering may be, network-level blocking does help some parents, though it won\u2019t solve your problems.</p> <p>However, you can get better family filtering by using <a href=\"https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227988047-Web-Content-Filtering-and-Security\">OpenDNS</a>, and this also allows you to block specific sites such as Facebook and Instagram. How-To Geek has an illustrated guide, <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/201312/how-to-use-opendns-on-your-router-pc-tablet-or-smartphone/\">How to Use OpenDNS on Your Router, PC, Tablet, or Smartphone</a>.</p> <p>DNS is the internet\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">domain name system</a>. It translates memorable names (such as Facebook.com) into the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address\">numerical IP addresses</a> (such as 69.63.176.13) used to navigate to internet sites. Usually, your ISP will provide your DNS service, but <a href=\"https://signup.opendns.com/homefree/\">OpenDNS Home</a> offers a free alternative.</p> <p>Normally, this will only change the DNS when the phone is using wifi.

I have not tried it, and can\u2019t confirm that it will work with your network, or at all.</p> <p>If you take these routes, you may be in for an extended game of Whac-A-Mole.

Even if you control his phone, your son may be able to access services via other devices such as PCs and tablets, either at home or at friends\u2019 houses. In most cases, he can set up new accounts using any fake name or pseudonym he wants, a made-up birthday, and other spurious details. Few sites apart from Facebook try to enforce a real names policy. Few free sites have a way of checking someone\u2019s age, and asking for a credit card number or government-backed ID would just stop people from signing up. Amusingly, the domain name that the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS) suggested to \u201cstay informed about the development of a public standard for age verification by the British Standards Institute\u201d \u2013 http://www.agecheckstandard.com \u2013 is currently for sale for $1,795. Network blocking An alternative sanction would be to block access to sites that you don\u2019t want your son to use. Most British internet service providers offer age-related filtering services, which are supposed to stop under 18s from seeing harmful content. Mobile network operators also provide filtering, and the largest UK networks may apply it by default to new phones. You usually have to be an age-verified adult bill payer to change this. The Open Rights Group\u2019s Blocked website says it has detected more than 600,000 sites that have been blocked by one or more of BT, Virgin, Sky, Vodafone, EE and O2. Many are ridiculous, including ClassicFM and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Unreliable as their filtering may be, network-level blocking does help some parents, though it won\u2019t solve your problems. However, you can get better family filtering by using OpenDNS, and this also allows you to block specific sites such as Facebook and Instagram. How-To Geek has an illustrated guide, How to Use OpenDNS on Your Router, PC, Tablet, or Smartphone. DNS is the internet\u2019s domain name system. It translates memorable names (such as Facebook.com) into the numerical IP addresses (such as 69.63.176.13) used to navigate to internet sites. Usually, your ISP will provide your DNS service, but OpenDNS Home offers a free alternative. Normally, this will only change the DNS when the phone is using wifi. However, there is an Android app that claims to change the DNS for the mobile data network as well. I have not tried it, and can\u2019t confirm that it will work with your network, or at all. If you take these routes, you may be in for an extended game of Whac-A-Mole. It would be better to work towards a negotiated social solution, rather than a technological one. Have you got a question?

They found that regardless of which model was used, there will be significant economic damage (in the range of tens to hundreds of billions of Euros per year) in the warming future. They also showed that the population affected in Europe by future flooding will grow significantly in the future.

We know humans are warming the planet. What we really want to know is what the effect is. Only by comparing costs of action to costs of inaction can we make wise decisions. So far, the research is telling us that it is much wiser to take action now to reduce warming (mitigation) than just ignore greenhouse gases and try to adapt to a harsh future climate. <br></p> <p>Studies like this give lie to people who claim that it is too expensive to take action on climate change. What this study shows is it may be too expensive to do nothing.</p>",

But the authors went a step further; they calculated the expected economic damage from future flooding for the three different temperature increases. They found that regardless of which model was used, there will be significant economic damage (in the range of tens to hundreds of billions of Euros per year) in the warming future. They also showed that the population affected in Europe by future flooding will grow significantly in the future. Roughly estimated, 500,000 to 1 million people are expected to be affected by flooding in the future climate. What I like about this study is it tries to tackle the problem of quantifying a cost of climate change. We know humans are warming the planet. What we really want to know is what the effect is. Only by comparing costs of action to costs of inaction can we make wise decisions. So far, the research is telling us that it is much wiser to take action now to reduce warming (mitigation) than just ignore greenhouse gases and try to adapt to a harsh future climate. Studies like this give lie to people who claim that it is too expensive to take action on climate change. What this study shows is it may be too expensive to do nothing.",

He turned down Troubleshooter, about terrorists on a cruise line, because he thought it was too similar to Under Siege (it was later gussied up to be, ahem, Speed 2: Cruise Control) but was impressed with Simon Says. It was a script that was originally set to star Brandon Lee but was rewritten to be a Lethal Weapon sequel and was then repositioned yet again and spat out as the third Die Hard film. The process worked and the film was the second-biggest worldwide hit of 1995. The next film was then also based on a pre-existing script, ensuring that a key lesson was learned: keep being lazy!</p> \n<h2>Saw II</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b26ed76976e899f541ad2c2e3612aebf9aaf59f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b26ed76976e899f541ad2c2e3612aebf9aaf59f/0_135_2100_1260/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saw II\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>When Saw opened with $18m in 2004, Lionsgate spotted a franchise in the making and, given the first film\u2019s minuscule $1.2m budget, a hugely profitable one at that.

The music video director Darren Lynn Bousman\u2019s script The Desperate was doing the rounds at the time yet he was struggling to get it made, with too many execs likening it to a Saw knock-off.

Damien Chazelle was brought in to rewrite but his plans to direct fell through once his passion project Whiplash received funding, and Dan Trachtenberg replaced him. Production began in 2014 and Abrams started to see similarities in tone to 2008\u2019s Cloverfield (a direct sequel was cancelled after both Godzilla and Pacific Rim came out). The decision was made to make it a blood relative rather than a sequel, but the plans were kept secret from the crew and cast-members \u2013 who only found out when the trailer was launched in January 2016, with the new title. The resulting film was a hit and a critical darling, with a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, even better then the original.</p> \n<h2>Evan Almighty</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53f4cb4c4fa18fdaf1657bdf8b6fc2ed9867cadf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53f4cb4c4fa18fdaf1657bdf8b6fc2ed9867cadf/0_156_2357_1414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan Almighty\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2004, a spec script called The Passion of the Ark was sold for $2.5m, at the time a record for a film written by unproduced talent.

Since the Bruce Almighty star Jim Carrey had turned it down, his co-star Steve Carrell was promoted to lead. Oedekerk also started from scratch, using just a the script\u2019s loose concept and meaning that the original writers, Bobby Florsheim and Josh Stolberg, didn\u2019t receive a credit on the finished product.

The headache-inducing process for Solace started back in 2002, when New Line picked up a script from the Ocean\u2019s Eleven writer Ted Griffin about a clairvoyant helping the FBI find a serial killer. It was then reshaped into Ei8ht, a sequel to David Fincher\u2019s bleak thriller Se7en, and would have seen Morgan Freeman\u2019s character return but this time with psychic powers. An inarguably horrible idea, then; after Fincher took umbrage at such silliness, it was shelved and years later, refashioned back into a non-sequel. The Elizabeth director, Shekhar Kapur, was briefly attached, with Bruce Willis in the lead, but ultimately, it seeped on to the screen with Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell starring and precisely no one caring.</p>",

The review draws parallels to the case of Winterbourne View, the private hospital near Bristol where people with severe learning difficulties were abused. Mendip House was home to six adults and had a staff of 26. It was one of seven dwellings at the National Autistic Society\u2019s Somerset Court campus. At the time, Somerset Court was home to 42 adults with severe autism placed by 30 local authorities and clinical commissioning groups from across the UK. Set in 26 acres (10.5 hectares) of land near Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset Court was the first specialist centre for people with autism in the UK. While Mendip House has closed, Somerset Court still operates. The report says some of the residents had experienced abuse and assaults in other homes. Some families had fought to get a place for their son or daughter at Somerset Court, trusting that they would receive excellent care. One of the victims, a man in his 50s, had lived at Somerset Court for more than 40 years, his place funded by a London borough. Staff threw cake at his head and put crayons in his coffee. When he asked for a biscuit he was given an onion and when he would not eat it, he was sent to his room. A man in his 50s whose place was funded by a Scottish authority was made to crawl on all fours. His anticonvulsant medication was lost. Another man always flinched in the presence of a particular staff member. The report calls on the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and the Local Government Association to carry out a national consultation on steps to regulate the commissioning of care placements. It says local authorities and clinical commissioning groups need to take responsibility to actively monitor the quality of care provided for the people they place. Richard Crompton, the independent chair of the SSAB, said: \u201cThis happened to be in Somerset, but the weaknesses in the system are nationwide and must be considered at that level.\u201d Mark Lever, the chief executive of the National Autistic Society, apologised for the mistreatment residents had suffered. \u201cPeople living at our Mendip House care service were not shown proper care and respect and were mistreated by a group of our staff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people raised the alarm \u2026 we took immediate action to make sure residents were safe and to investigate what went wrong. We brought in different staff who knew the people living in the house to ensure they were well supported. \u201cWe also disciplined and then dismissed staff. After deciding to close the service, we supported families and their home local authorities while they found the six residents alternative places to live, helping them through what could have been a difficult transition to their new homes.\u201d",

Researchers say people automatically associate male games with competitive spirit, discipline, stamina and devotion to a team.</p> \n<p>However, recent studies have identified a slight shift in perception, indicating that attitudes towards sports and gender roles may now be more nuanced. Some sports, including snowboarding and freestyle skiing, are now considered gender-neutral. They are mostly individual non-contact activities that are both risky (a traditionally masculine trait), and gracious (hence feminine). In such sports, much like in figure skating, judges rate performances both by difficulty and aesthetics. These are also sports that tend to be more open to women.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/02/archive-zip/giv-3902cVCDuJX6OaSq\" data-alt=\"Recap\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/02/archive-zip/giv-3902cVCDuJX6OaSq\">Recap</a> \n</figure> \n<p>People\u2019s perception of sports as male or female-appropriate has had a huge impact on how quickly, or slowly, women managed to gain acceptance to compete alongside men.

      "bodyText": "Among the 258 athletes lining up at the start of the first Winter Olympics held in 1924 in Chamonix, only 11 were female, all of them figure skaters. The length of their skirts, reaching a palm-width below the knee, caused a furore. There have been more and more women competing in the Winter Olympics ever since. This year, for the first time in history, South Korea and North Korea are sending a joint women\u2019s ice hockey team to the Games. Three Nigerian women are the first African team to compete in an Olympic bobsled event, having made their first sled out of wood and scraps four years earlier. Does this mean women also have finally reached parity with men? The percentage of women competing at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games is \u2026 A look at the Olympic Games through the years reveals how women made strides in winter sports, albeit slowly. In Chamonix there was only one event for women, while in 2018 all but two disciplines offer equal chances to men and women to participate. As more events were opened to women, most countries sent more female athletes to the Olympics. Some, though, didn\u2019t follow the trend. Three nations, Brunei, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, banned women from competing altogether until the 2012 Summer Games in London, and have yet to send a female athlete to the Winter Olympics. China stands out as the only country with female-majority teams at all Winter Olympic Games since 1988. Chinese sportswomen started to receive equal coaching, equipment, facilities, and wages in the 1950s \u2014 two or more decades earlier than in many western countries. They were soon bringing in more medals than their male counterparts, which earned them even more support. Playing catch-up A few sports have been open to both men and women from the beginning, mainly those added to the Olympic programme after the 1990s, such as snowboarding. But even as other sports became open to women, the number of events for women and men was usually not equal. Even in disciplines where female athletes have achieved equal participation, many of their events have different durations and distances, stereotyping women as weaker and less skilled than men. Breaking into men\u2019s territory Sport has traditionally been regarded as primarily a male territory, and female athletes have always had to fight against gender stereotypes portraying women as weaker than men. The more physical and extreme the sport \u2013 hence more masculine in our eyes \u2013 the harder it has been for women to break in. Researchers found that sports that are beautiful, graceful, nonaggressive, non-contact or aesthetically pleasing are typically considered most appropriate for women. They require precision and advanced skills, and are usually individual rather than team events. On the other hand, face-to-face competition, aggression and body contact are seen as masculine. Researchers say people automatically associate male games with competitive spirit, discipline, stamina and devotion to a team. However, recent studies have identified a slight shift in perception, indicating that attitudes towards sports and gender roles may now be more nuanced. Some sports, including snowboarding and freestyle skiing, are now considered gender-neutral. They are mostly individual non-contact activities that are both risky (a traditionally masculine trait), and gracious (hence feminine). In such sports, much like in figure skating, judges rate performances both by difficulty and aesthetics. These are also sports that tend to be more open to women. People\u2019s perception of sports as male or female-appropriate has had a huge impact on how quickly, or slowly, women managed to gain acceptance to compete alongside men. Take the quiz to test your own perception and see what studies have to say about it. If this sport had a gender, what would it be?

I understand that gender identity and biological sex are different, and that anyway biological sex is not so straightforward as was once thought. I believe in a non-binary future (the writers Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Virginia Woolf, two of my heroes, were pioneers of such ideas).

I put myself forward after taking part in a year-long political mentoring programme run by the Fabian Women\u2019s Network to increase the representation of women in politics. This scheme totally demystified power and politics for me, and helped me understand even more clearly why women with intersectional identities are still missing from the hallways, corridors, rooms and chambers in the House of Commons. We are locked out from these spaces because of structural inequalities that exist in wider society. There is no level playing field for women with intersectional identities: for black women, lesbian women, trans women, disabled women, Muslim women, women of faith and working-class women. It doesn\u2019t matter how talented we are or how much we know, we face reinforced concrete ceilings in politics based on discrimination. The inconvenient truth is that the so-called sisterhood doesn\u2019t work for all women; it never has and it never will unless the gatekeepers understand they need to make way for the most marginalised women to step to the front and amplify their voices \u2013 this is what true feminism is. Many white cis women \u2013 the women with power and privilege \u2013 are just as likely as some white men to pull up the ladder behind them, and in so doing further reinforce the patriarchy. There should be absolutely no question of self-identifying trans women being accepted on all-women short lists. Of course our trans sisters should be in this space. These are the women on the margins of our society and most at risk of rape, sexual violence and abuse. \u2022 Shaista Aziz is a journalist and a member of the Fabian women\u2019s executive committee Susanna Rustin: Of course all women are eligible, but female anatomy is not irrelevant All women must be eligible for all-women shortlists, and the current furore \u2013 which is not limited to the Labour party: this week also saw a confrontation on breakfast TV about whether trans women are entitled to work in women\u2019s shelters \u2013 is partly the government\u2019s fault.

We all grow up hearing homo- and transphobia, and, as I say in my book Straight Jacket, LGBT kids aren\u2019t given magical earplugs. Research now shows how destructive shame can be. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html\" title=\"\">Adverse Childhood Experience study</a> led by Dr Vincent Felitti showed that the greater number of extreme negative experiences a child has, the greater the chance they will develop mental health problems in adulthood. The study showed the most damaging experience was not incest, as expected, but \u201crecurrent chronic humiliation\u201d \u2013 in other words, if you invalidate and criticise children over and over, you\u2019ll dramatically increase the chance they\u2019ll develop self-destructive mental health problems in adulthood. This should be front-page news.</p> <p>Gay people are not the only ones to suffer such shame, but experts, both gay and straight, agree that gay kids are overwhelmed with it. Many of us grow up, come out and have wonderful and happy lives. For others, the journey can be rockier. Many bury their feelings, hoping they\u2019ll go away, some psychologically \u201csplit\u201d, like the heterosexually married men who believe anonymous internet hook-ups don\u2019t count as gay if they happen in secret. Just this week I met a young man who told me he hated gay pride, hated effeminate men but crucially was trying to work through these feelings by talking about them. The gay community doesn\u2019t talk about this enough, and when we do it\u2019s often with judgment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people grappling with shame do not join extremist groups and plan to hurt people.

All in a year that saw the usual reports of unsupported LGBT teenagers killing themselves, such as a 15-year-old in Stirling, after years of bullying, and a 16-year-old girl whose life-support machine was turned off after doing the same.

      "bodyText": "If Ethan Stables, the 20-year-old man convicted on Monday of planning to kill attendees of a local gay pride event in Cumbria, was really bisexual as he claimed in court, why would he want to hurt other LGBT people? Sadly he wouldn\u2019t be the first. Many gay people know the most homophobic school bully often pops up in the local gay bar a few years later, but there are wider examples: Hollywood agents who bar clients from coming out, historical figures such as Senator McCarthy\u2019s anti-gay lawyer Roy Cohn, who maintained till the end that the Aids-related illness that killed him was liver cancer, the countless homophobic politicians caught with male escorts. But self-loathing can turn deadly. Omar Mateen, who committed America\u2019s most deadly homophobic attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in 2016, pledged his allegiance to Isis but was also alleged to have made sexual advances towards men. His ex-wife said she believed he was gay. We don\u2019t talk about it much, but many people struggle to feel at ease being anything other than heterosexual, even years after coming out. We all grow up hearing homo- and transphobia, and, as I say in my book Straight Jacket, LGBT kids aren\u2019t given magical earplugs. Research now shows how destructive shame can be. The Adverse Childhood Experience study led by Dr Vincent Felitti showed that the greater number of extreme negative experiences a child has, the greater the chance they will develop mental health problems in adulthood. The study showed the most damaging experience was not incest, as expected, but \u201crecurrent chronic humiliation\u201d \u2013 in other words, if you invalidate and criticise children over and over, you\u2019ll dramatically increase the chance they\u2019ll develop self-destructive mental health problems in adulthood. This should be front-page news. Gay people are not the only ones to suffer such shame, but experts, both gay and straight, agree that gay kids are overwhelmed with it. Many of us grow up, come out and have wonderful and happy lives. For others, the journey can be rockier. Many bury their feelings, hoping they\u2019ll go away, some psychologically \u201csplit\u201d, like the heterosexually married men who believe anonymous internet hook-ups don\u2019t count as gay if they happen in secret. Just this week I met a young man who told me he hated gay pride, hated effeminate men but crucially was trying to work through these feelings by talking about them. The gay community doesn\u2019t talk about this enough, and when we do it\u2019s often with judgment. Perhaps Ethan Stables, who has an autistic spectrum disorder, was not able to have those conversations. Most people grappling with shame do not join extremist groups and plan to hurt people. But some do. Perhaps like former notorious 1980s neo-Nazi street fighter Nicky Crane, who also eventually came out as gay. Talking about gay shame and self-loathing is not easy. It flies in the face of the message of gay pride that has dominated the gay rights movement of the last 50 years. But we must talk about it. Most people wrestling with shame hurt themselves. Disproportionate numbers of LGBT people suffer with self-destructive behaviour. At the end of 2016 we lost George Michael after years of mental health and addiction struggles. A year later, last November, 21-year-old American rapper Lil Peep died from a fentanyl overdose months after he came out as bisexual. Just last month, the 38-year-old presenter of the Discovery Channel\u2019s Storm Chaser programme, Joel Taylor, died from a GHB overdose on an Atlantis gay cruise. All in a year that saw the usual reports of unsupported LGBT teenagers killing themselves, such as a 15-year-old in Stirling, after years of bullying, and a 16-year-old girl whose life-support machine was turned off after doing the same. And so it goes on and on, without much awareness or enough being done to address the situation. Wider society has never cared about the children who struggle to come to terms with who they are. I was 11 when I realised I was gay and I could not cope. I needed support and someone to talk to. It wasn\u2019t there. But it seems perhaps the gay rights movement has been caught napping, too. So much focus has been on changing laws and encouraging footballers to come out or on promoting sexual freedom \u2013 all important things \u2013 that we\u2019ve missed the huge ground-level suffering of those struggling with the legacy of society\u2019s gay shame, right under our noses. It may not fit the narrative we wish to promote but there are huge numbers of people getting themselves into serious situations without enough support.

      "body": "<h2>1) Aston Villa 7-3 Small Heath (First Division, September 1895)</h2> <p>Villa dominated the Football League during its Victorian infancy \u2013 they racked up five titles by 1900 \u2013 so their early command of the Birmingham scene is no great surprise. In November 1887, they met the club that would become bitter city rivals in serious competition for the first time: Small Heath Alliance were dispatched 4-0 in the FA Cup second round. It was payback for the first friendly between the clubs in 1879, which Alliance won 1-0 at their Muntz Street ground. Villa \u2013 already a grand, bordering on aristocratic, institution despite being just four years and nine months old \u2013 complained bitterly that the pitch was full of holes.</p> <p>Small Heath reached the First Division in 1894, having quietly dropped the \u201cAlliance\u201d along the way. At this point, Villa were English champions, so won the first league meeting between the clubs 2-1 at their old Perry Barr stadium but could only scrape a 2-2 draw a month later at Muntz Street. A year later, Villa reasserted themselves in the grand fashion as they romped to a five-goal half-time lead at Perry Barr. The irrepressible Fred Wheldon pulled two back early in the second half, but the eel-fast James Cowan \u2013 who had devised a fictional bad back during Villa\u2019s 1893-94 title campaign so he could compete in a cash-money sprint in his native Scotland \u2013 reasserted Villa\u2019s authority with a sixth. Villa ran out 7-3 winners, won the return 4-1, and went on to win their second championship. Their poor rivals ended the season relegated.</p> <h2>2) Birmingham 5-2 Aston Villa (Lord Mayor of Birmingham Charity Cup, September 1908)</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/jun/19/what-we-miss-in-football\">The Joy of Six: What we miss in modern football | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Small Heath would never taste competitive victory over Villa. Not if we\u2019re being strictly pedantic. By the time Villa were eventually bested, 2-0 at Muntz Street in the First Division in September 1905, Small Heath had changed their name to Birmingham Football Club (the City appendage was another 39 years away). Having waited 18 years, a second Blues win in the derby arrived almost immediately: they won 3-1 at Villa Park four months later, then prevailed 3-2 at their new St Andrew\u2019s pad the following season. Then in September 1908, Blues recorded a splendid 5-2 victory in the Lord Mayor of Birmingham Charity Cup at St Andrew\u2019s. That game was notable for the travails of Villa striker \u201cHappy\u201d Harry Hampton, who smacked a second-half penalty straight at Jack Dorrington. The rebound fell to Hampton\u2019s strike partner Joe Bache, who was scythed to the ground by Frank Womack before he could slot home. Another penalty! Cue another miserable Hampton effort straight at Dorrington, who caught it this time and held on for dear life.</p> <p>It was a rare unhappy day for Harry. During his time at Villa he scored 215 goals in 341 league games, a club record that still stands; was their two-goal matchwinner in the 1905 FA Cup final against Newcastle; and on their successful run-in to the 1909-10 league title, notched two hat-tricks in 24 hours against Middlesbrough and Bury. Not afraid of putting in a challenge, he was one of the few players to successfully bundle notoriously well-upholstered goalkeeper William \u201cFatty\u201d Foulke into the net. After serving on the Somme in the Great War, Hampton joined Birmingham as a 35-year-old veteran, was converted into a winger, and promptly scored nine in his first five games. But this was an off day.</p> <h2>3) Aston Villa 3-3 Birmingham (First Division, October 1925)</h2> <p>Having run the rule over Villa\u2019s record league goalscorer, it\u2019s only fair to give Birmingham\u2019s greatest marksman our consideration. Joe Bradford cost Blues \u00a3125 from Leicestershire village team Peggs Green Victoria in 1920; by the time he left for Bristol City in 1935, he\u2019d rattled in 267 goals in 445 appearances. The next-best goalgetter in Birmingham\u2019s history is Trevor Francis, who managed 133 in 329.</p> <p>Bradford was the real deal. He scored 11 in eight days during a particularly fecund spell in September 1929, a five-goal haul for a representative Football League team against an equivalent Irish shower sandwiched by Blues hat-tricks against Newcastle and Blackburn. He also scored in his side\u2019s 2-1 defeat against West Brom in the 1931 FA Cup final. But arguably his finest couple of minutes came at Villa Park, with the hosts three goals to the good and 11 minutes remaining. Bradford scored a quickfire double, sending such a shiver down the spine of Villa keeper Cyril Spiers that, in attempting to gather a pea-roller of a shot by Jimmy Cringan, he slipped and hoicked into his own net. Three goals in five minutes, a highly unlikely point for Blues, and a slapstick goalkeeping template set for the future. But let\u2019s not riff on poor Peter Enckelman before we have to.</p> <h2>4) Birmingham City 3-1 Aston Villa (League Cup final, May 1963)</h2> <p>On the final day of the 1962-63 season, Birmingham City saved their First Division skin with a 3-2 win over Leicester, the seize-the-moment victory condemning Manchester City to relegation instead. There was a celebratory atmosphere at St Andrew\u2019s: at one point during the match, Bertie Auld ushered a small boy on to the field and played a quick one-two with him from a short corner. The ref ordered the lad off the pitch, and made a theatrically affronted Auld take the set piece again.</p> <p>The feelgood factor continued five days later, as Blues welcomed Villa for the first leg of the third League Cup final. Villa were favourites to lift the trophy for a second time, having finished comfortably in mid-table as Birmingham toiled. But they were thoroughly outplayed. The atmosphere was a little muted \u2013 cup finals were historically one-off Saturday afternoon affairs, and this first leg was played on a Thursday \u2013 though a boy scout band did their best to give the event a special atmosphere. Auld set up Ken Leek for the opener on 15 minutes, and though Bobby Thomson equalised, Birmingham opened a significant lead in the second half. Jimmy Harris set up Leek for his second, and then Jimmy Bloomfield embarked on a fine dribble and finished from a tight angle. It was a goal good enough to earn sporting applause from the scattered Villa defence. Villa had nothing in the return leg. Birmingham\u2019s defence stood resolute, and Trevor Smith lifted City\u2019s first major trophy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f915f4d030a0cf753feb36d372cd83db4c69f833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f915f4d030a0cf753feb36d372cd83db4c69f833/0_137_3808_2582/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Birmingham City with the League Cup trophy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birmingham City with the League Cup trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>5) Aston Villa 1-0 Birmingham City (First Division, October 1983)</h2> <p>Plying their trade this sodden afternoon on a waterlogged Villa Park pitch: Steve McMahon, Pat van den Hauwe, Noel Blake, Howard Gayle, Robert Hopkins, Colin Gibson, Mick Harford. In the away dugout: Ron Saunders, who had walked out on Villa harbouring stratospheric levels of underpaid resentment, taken up a position across town out of spite, and had subsequently spent time disparaging his successor Tony Barton in the press. Outside the ground beforehand: hour after hour of early-80s-style misbehaviour culminating in 80 arrests. What could possibly go wrong?</p> <p>The tone was set early when Gayle slid in robustly on young Villa winger Mark Walters. Peter Withe \u2013 Villa\u2019s European Cup-winning hero, but also an erstwhile Blue \u2013 arrived to wag his finger with theatrical fury. A provocative act, which the striker compounded by pouncing on a loose Van den Hauwe backpass to prod past Tony Coton. It was, by now, very much on. The temperature was taken up another notch when Birmingham thought they had equalised, Blake hoicking goalwards during a scramble in the Villa box. Nigel Spink hooked the ball off the line. Or was it over? Villa got the benefit of the doubt, stopping Blake and Gayle\u2019s celebrations mid-cavort. Tempers were further tweaked when Harford kicked a dead ball at Villa captain Dennis Mortimer, who momentarily considered instigating a nose-to-nose Socratic dialogue with his assailant, only to change his mind when the notoriously nails striker wound back his neck muscles with a view to planting the nut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d738cf4139dbdb816a0921579b78fae651bc1f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d738cf4139dbdb816a0921579b78fae651bc1f01/0_0_4989_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goal-line drama in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goal-line drama in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then the spark which exploded the tinder box.

According to Broadhurst, Hopkins, Blake, Gayle and Coton paid a visit to the Villa dressing room at half-time \u201cjust to say hello\u201d.

Hopkins \u2013 a boyhood Blue who had once played for Villa, and was once rumbled for wearing a Birmingham top under the claret-and-blue shirt \u2013 got involved by attempting to take out Mortimer and then Gibson.

      "bodyText": "1) Aston Villa 7-3 Small Heath (First Division, September 1895) Villa dominated the Football League during its Victorian infancy \u2013 they racked up five titles by 1900 \u2013 so their early command of the Birmingham scene is no great surprise. In November 1887, they met the club that would become bitter city rivals in serious competition for the first time: Small Heath Alliance were dispatched 4-0 in the FA Cup second round. It was payback for the first friendly between the clubs in 1879, which Alliance won 1-0 at their Muntz Street ground. Villa \u2013 already a grand, bordering on aristocratic, institution despite being just four years and nine months old \u2013 complained bitterly that the pitch was full of holes. Small Heath reached the First Division in 1894, having quietly dropped the \u201cAlliance\u201d along the way. At this point, Villa were English champions, so won the first league meeting between the clubs 2-1 at their old Perry Barr stadium but could only scrape a 2-2 draw a month later at Muntz Street. A year later, Villa reasserted themselves in the grand fashion as they romped to a five-goal half-time lead at Perry Barr. The irrepressible Fred Wheldon pulled two back early in the second half, but the eel-fast James Cowan \u2013 who had devised a fictional bad back during Villa\u2019s 1893-94 title campaign so he could compete in a cash-money sprint in his native Scotland \u2013 reasserted Villa\u2019s authority with a sixth. Villa ran out 7-3 winners, won the return 4-1, and went on to win their second championship. Their poor rivals ended the season relegated. 2) Birmingham 5-2 Aston Villa (Lord Mayor of Birmingham Charity Cup, September 1908) Small Heath would never taste competitive victory over Villa. Not if we\u2019re being strictly pedantic. By the time Villa were eventually bested, 2-0 at Muntz Street in the First Division in September 1905, Small Heath had changed their name to Birmingham Football Club (the City appendage was another 39 years away). Having waited 18 years, a second Blues win in the derby arrived almost immediately: they won 3-1 at Villa Park four months later, then prevailed 3-2 at their new St Andrew\u2019s pad the following season. Then in September 1908, Blues recorded a splendid 5-2 victory in the Lord Mayor of Birmingham Charity Cup at St Andrew\u2019s. That game was notable for the travails of Villa striker \u201cHappy\u201d Harry Hampton, who smacked a second-half penalty straight at Jack Dorrington. The rebound fell to Hampton\u2019s strike partner Joe Bache, who was scythed to the ground by Frank Womack before he could slot home. Another penalty! Cue another miserable Hampton effort straight at Dorrington, who caught it this time and held on for dear life. It was a rare unhappy day for Harry. During his time at Villa he scored 215 goals in 341 league games, a club record that still stands; was their two-goal matchwinner in the 1905 FA Cup final against Newcastle; and on their successful run-in to the 1909-10 league title, notched two hat-tricks in 24 hours against Middlesbrough and Bury. Not afraid of putting in a challenge, he was one of the few players to successfully bundle notoriously well-upholstered goalkeeper William \u201cFatty\u201d Foulke into the net. After serving on the Somme in the Great War, Hampton joined Birmingham as a 35-year-old veteran, was converted into a winger, and promptly scored nine in his first five games.

      "body": "<p>Coco Schumann, who has died aged 93, was always at pains to stress that he was, as he put it, \u201ca musician who spent time in a concentration camp, not a concentration camp prisoner who made music\u201d. He said that music had defined his life, and he was convinced it was music that had been responsible for his survival.</p> <p>Partly out of a wish not to allow the Nazis a prominent place in his biography, and because he thought no one would believe his story, and partly because of the horrors he had witnessed during the more than two years he spent incarcerated, it took him more than half a century to talk about the experience. \u201cFor years I didn\u2019t speak about it, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Dachau, I thought no one would believe I had been in those places,\u201d he said in 2014.</p> <p>But one day, at an event for concentration camp survivors in the mid-1980s, someone challenged him. \u201cHe said to me, if you don\u2019t speak about it, who will tell people what really happened there? And in that moment a switch turned on in me, and I thought he was right,\u201d Schumann said. He became increasingly aware of the importance of his role as one of the last remaining \u201cfirst voice\u201d eye-witnesses of the Holocaust.</p> <p>Schumann was infected by the jazz bug at the age of 13, when a friend played him Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s new record A-Tisket A-Tasket, at a time when people held secret gramophone sessions with their friends to savour a music genre that had been officially classed as <em>Negermusik</em> (literally nigger music) and therefore \u201cdegenerate\u201d by the Nazis. He taught himself the guitar and went on to make his name in Berlin\u2019s underground jazz scene, where he regularly performed as a minor in a Gypsy swing band.</p> <p>Owing to his father\u2019s conversion to Judaism out of love for his mother, Schumann was classified as a <em>Geltungsjude</em>, or a person considered a Jew by law, and lived in permanent fear of being deported.</p> <p>His first close shave came in 1942 when a group of SS officers entered the Berlin bar where he was playing, to arrest a Jewish member of the audience. Convinced of his own imminent capture, Schumann <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/de/deutschlands-ber%C3%BChmtester-swing-gitarrist-coco-schumann-ist-tot/a-17785405\">recalled</a> approaching one of the officers and saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to arrest him, you might as well arrest me too.\u201d When asked why, he replied: \u201cFirst of all I\u2019m Jewish, secondly, I\u2019m underage, and thirdly, I\u2019m playing jazz.\u201d He was ignored until a year later, after \u2013 so he always suspected \u2013 a romantic rival and a regular in the Rosita bar, where he often played, informed on him.</p> <p>Schumann was transported in 1943 to Theresienstadt, in what is now Terezin, Czech Republic. There, aged 19, he began playing in a band called the Ghetto Swingers, founded by the Czech trumpeter Eric Vogel. In September 1944, they were given clean white shirts to perform in a propaganda film \u2013 an extension of a hoax played on the Red Cross the previous summer pretending that Jews had a decent life in the camp \u2013 to show the breadth of cultural activities on offer in the so-called \u201csettlement\u201d. The 20 minutes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP8eYTwmPt0\">the film</a> that survives includes footage of the band leader, Martin Roman, and his elegant Ghetto Swingers performing in a bucolic scene in a pavilion in the park.</p> <p>Immediately after, Schumann was deported to Auschwitz, along with other cast members and the director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jun/02/1\">Kurt Gerron</a>, and his wife. There, thanks to a musician friend who recognised him, he was commandeered into a swing band that had the job of accompanying the tattooing of new arrivals and the selection process for the gas chambers, both to ease the SS guards\u2019 boredom and to prevent panic among those who should not know they were going to their deaths. On a guitar that had belonged to a murdered Romani musician, Schumann was forced to play requests from the soldiers for hours at a time, everything from La Paloma to Alexander\u2019s Ragtime Band. He later said he had always avoided the gazes of the children.</p> <p>Born Heinz Schumann in Berlin, to Alfred, a decorator, and Hedwig (nee Rothholz), a hairdresser, he inherited a drum kit from his Uncle Arthur who was emigrating to Bolivia, and a six-string guitar from a cousin called up to the Wehrmacht. Heinz got his nickname, Coco, from a French girlfriend.</p> <p>Having survived Auschwitz, where he nearly died from spotted fever, and then Dachau, Schumann was liberated by American troops in Bavaria while on a death march towards Innsbruck, and returned to his home city. His autobiography, The Ghetto Swinger: A Berlin Jazz-Legend Remembers (1997), which was turned into a musical in 2012, described being received back in the bars and clubs he had previously played in, as if he were a ghost appearing. \u201cEveryone was surprised I\u2019d survived,\u201d he said.</p> <p>It was while wandering down the bombed-out Kurf\u00fcrstendamm boulevard in 1945 that Schumann met his future wife, Gertraud Goldschmidt, who approached him after recognising him as a member of the Ghetto Swingers from the time she herself had spent in Theresienstadt.</p> <p>In 1950 he emigrated with Gertraud and her son to Australia, returning, homesick, in 1954, and subsequently spent years performing as a musician on cruise ships or playing with dance bands and radio ensembles and accompanying among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jun/22/1\">Marlene Dietrich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-ella-fitzgerald-1337549.html\">Ella Fitzgerald</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/16/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\">Helmut Zacharias</a>. But he rarely revealed much about his past, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to think people were applauding me out of sympathy.\u201d In the 1990s, buoyed by the nostalgic comeback of swing, he formed the Coco Schumann Quartet, which enjoyed success and earned him considerable attention.</p> <p>He was quick-witted, warm and charming, with a string of homemade bons mots always to hand, which one friend habitually recorded in a notebook that was published as a book, Coco, in 2015. In recent years, he suffered a brain tumour and that, and an injury to his finger following a fall in the summer of 2014, more or less put paid to performing in public. But he never stopped his daily habit of plucking at one of the many electric guitars he kept around his Berlin bungalow.</p> <p>His 90th birthday was marked by a tribute gala put on by Germany\u2019s cultural and political elite. Asked once how he managed to continue performing the very melodies he was forced to play in Auschwitz, that accompanied people to their deaths, Schumann replied: \u201cWhy should the music be tainted for the fact it was violated by the Nazis?\u201d He added: \u201cThe pictures that burned themselves into my memory in Auschwitz are something I am forced to endure the whole time, regardless of whether I\u2019m playing the tunes or not.\u201d</p> <p>His wife predeceased him. He is survived by his stepson, Peter, and his younger brother, J\u00fcrgen.</p> <p>\u2022 Heinz Jakob \u201cCoco\u201d Schumann, jazz guitarist and Holocaust survivor, born 14 May 1924; died 28 January 2018</p>",

Owing to his father\u2019s conversion to Judaism out of love for his mother, Schumann was classified as a Geltungsjude, or a person considered a Jew by law, and lived in permanent fear of being deported. His first close shave came in 1942 when a group of SS officers entered the Berlin bar where he was playing, to arrest a Jewish member of the audience. Convinced of his own imminent capture, Schumann recalled approaching one of the officers and saying: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to arrest him, you might as well arrest me too.\u201d When asked why, he replied: \u201cFirst of all I\u2019m Jewish, secondly, I\u2019m underage, and thirdly, I\u2019m playing jazz.\u201d He was ignored until a year later, after \u2013 so he always suspected \u2013 a romantic rival and a regular in the Rosita bar, where he often played, informed on him. Schumann was transported in 1943 to Theresienstadt, in what is now Terezin, Czech Republic. There, aged 19, he began playing in a band called the Ghetto Swingers, founded by the Czech trumpeter Eric Vogel. In September 1944, they were given clean white shirts to perform in a propaganda film \u2013 an extension of a hoax played on the Red Cross the previous summer pretending that Jews had a decent life in the camp \u2013 to show the breadth of cultural activities on offer in the so-called \u201csettlement\u201d. The 20 minutes of the film that survives includes footage of the band leader, Martin Roman, and his elegant Ghetto Swingers performing in a bucolic scene in a pavilion in the park. Immediately after, Schumann was deported to Auschwitz, along with other cast members and the director, Kurt Gerron, and his wife. There, thanks to a musician friend who recognised him, he was commandeered into a swing band that had the job of accompanying the tattooing of new arrivals and the selection process for the gas chambers, both to ease the SS guards\u2019 boredom and to prevent panic among those who should not know they were going to their deaths. On a guitar that had belonged to a murdered Romani musician, Schumann was forced to play requests from the soldiers for hours at a time, everything from La Paloma to Alexander\u2019s Ragtime Band. He later said he had always avoided the gazes of the children. Born Heinz Schumann in Berlin, to Alfred, a decorator, and Hedwig (nee Rothholz), a hairdresser, he inherited a drum kit from his Uncle Arthur who was emigrating to Bolivia, and a six-string guitar from a cousin called up to the Wehrmacht. Heinz got his nickname, Coco, from a French girlfriend. Having survived Auschwitz, where he nearly died from spotted fever, and then Dachau, Schumann was liberated by American troops in Bavaria while on a death march towards Innsbruck, and returned to his home city. His autobiography, The Ghetto Swinger: A Berlin Jazz-Legend Remembers (1997), which was turned into a musical in 2012, described being received back in the bars and clubs he had previously played in, as if he were a ghost appearing. \u201cEveryone was surprised I\u2019d survived,\u201d he said. It was while wandering down the bombed-out Kurf\u00fcrstendamm boulevard in 1945 that Schumann met his future wife, Gertraud Goldschmidt, who approached him after recognising him as a member of the Ghetto Swingers from the time she herself had spent in Theresienstadt. In 1950 he emigrated with Gertraud and her son to Australia, returning, homesick, in 1954, and subsequently spent years performing as a musician on cruise ships or playing with dance bands and radio ensembles and accompanying among others, Marlene Dietrich, Ella Fitzgerald and Helmut Zacharias. But he rarely revealed much about his past, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to think people were applauding me out of sympathy.\u201d In the 1990s, buoyed by the nostalgic comeback of swing, he formed the Coco Schumann Quartet, which enjoyed success and earned him considerable attention. He was quick-witted, warm and charming, with a string of homemade bons mots always to hand, which one friend habitually recorded in a notebook that was published as a book, Coco, in 2015. In recent years, he suffered a brain tumour and that, and an injury to his finger following a fall in the summer of 2014, more or less put paid to performing in public. But he never stopped his daily habit of plucking at one of the many electric guitars he kept around his Berlin bungalow. His 90th birthday was marked by a tribute gala put on by Germany\u2019s cultural and political elite. Asked once how he managed to continue performing the very melodies he was forced to play in Auschwitz, that accompanied people to their deaths, Schumann replied: \u201cWhy should the music be tainted for the fact it was violated by the Nazis?\u201d He added: \u201cThe pictures that burned themselves into my memory in Auschwitz are something I am forced to endure the whole time, regardless of whether I\u2019m playing the tunes or not.\u201d His wife predeceased him. He is survived by his stepson, Peter, and his younger brother, J\u00fcrgen. \u2022 Heinz Jakob \u201cCoco\u201d Schumann, jazz guitarist and Holocaust survivor, born 14 May 1924; died 28 January 2018",

Remove the pan from the heat and let sit, still covered, for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes is up, gently stir up the rice and serve with your chosen recipe. Beef, onion and sweet soy (main picture) Gyudon \u2013 a humble bowl of beef on rice \u2013 is a bit like Japan\u2019s answer to a burger. Cooking off the onions releases an irresistible \u201chotdog stand\u201d aroma, so it\u2019s comforting even before you tuck in. Sweet and beefy and savoury and satisfying.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame, then add the onions and sweat, stirring, until they are soft and brown, about 10 minutes. Add the ginger and cook for a few minutes, to soften. Add the soy, mirin, sugar and stock, and cook until the sauce has reduced to a syrupy consistency \u2013 about 10 minutes. Stir the beef through the sauce, and cook together for just a few more minutes, until the beef is no longer pink.

Add the chicken and mushrooms, and cook for another five to 10 minutes, until these brown as well. Pour in the stock, soy, mirin and sugar, and cook for 10 minutes, or until the liquid reduces and coats the chicken. Lower the heat and crack in the eggs. Break the yolks and stir gently. When cooked to a semi-scrambled consistency, take off the heat. Scoop the rice into deep bowls, top with the chicken and egg mixture, and garnish with spring onions and chilli powder.

When Haider compared uninsured black patients to insured white patients, the black patients were 80% more likely to die. </p> <p>To unpick why this was the case, Haider and others in his field began to look at trauma centre rankings, which are based on scores called observed-to-expected mortality ratios. Trauma centres have developed a finely-tuned science of predicting an individual\u2019s chances of dying from a particular degree of injury, allowing them to calculate the proportion of patients who survive compared to the projections.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Haider compared uninsured black patients to insured white patients, the black patients were 80% more likely to die</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23979271\">studies showed</a> that it tends to be the worst-performing trauma centres that take care of the vast majority of uninsured black and ethnic minority patients in inner-city areas. These centres are faced with a lot of highly complex, penetrative trauma cases, and because their patients typically lack insurance, they\u2019re faced with negative financial margins and few resources with which to improve their processes.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a vicious cycle which plays out,\u201d Haider says. \u201cFirst you have these struggling trauma centres which are already laden with a lot of patients without insurance, and then they get penalised because their outcomes are worse. And that makes it even more difficult for them to deliver the best care.\u201d </p> <p>But while the introduction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/26/senate-republicans-vote-doomed-healthcare-bill\">Affordable Care Act</a> has improved the accessibility of insurance, and reduced the strain on some centres, there\u2019s one crucial factor in trauma care which means the odds are still greatly stacked against black and minority patients from poorer communities: time. </p> <h2><strong>Trauma deserts</strong></h2> <p>In emergency medicine, time is one of the most crucial factors relating to survival. Paramedics say that the sooner a patient with a traumatic injury can be sent to a high-level centre, the greater the likelihood of preventing death. However, in the US, many of the best for-profit trauma centres have long sought to maximise their revenue streams by focusing on areas where the majority of patients have insurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bdcc71ef73a293a602a9012e24eef2679000f09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bdcc71ef73a293a602a9012e24eef2679000f09/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In trauma care, time is one of the most crucial factors relating to survival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In trauma care, time is one of the most crucial factors relating to survival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Florida is one such example. With a large demographic of retired, insured, white people, trauma centres can make a lot of money from treating patients with traumatic injuries following falls, resulting in an abundance of care facilities. However, Chicago\u2019s often violent South Side, in which 93% of the population is black, has long faced a \u201ctrauma desert\u201d, after the main University of Chicago trauma unit closed down two decades ago due to financial strain. Despite widespread protests and studies suggesting that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-lns-trauma-deaths-prevented-by-center-proximity-st-0723-20160722-story.html\">one in five patients</a> could have been saved if they\u2019d received treatment quicker, there is still no level 1 trauma centre located in the area. </p> <p>In addition, Haider is convinced other factors are at play. When he compared black insured patients to white insured patients, black patients were still 20% more likely to die.</p> <p> \u201cBias from healthcare providers could also be an important factor,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that trauma happens to certain types of people, who deserve it because they\u2019re from the wrong side of town, and even well-meaning, highly qualified people end up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/01/human-brain-is-predisposed-to-negative-stereotypes-new-study-suggests\">falling into that bias</a>.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>Of the one million people who have taken the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.understandingprejudice.org/iat/\">online implicit association test</a> \u2013 a social psychology experiment designed by psychologists at Harvard University to detect the automatic associations between different races/genders and certain concepts which are stored subconsciously \u2013 approximately 70% showed preferences towards white people. Haider conducted similar tests on doctors, trainee surgeons and nurses using clinical vignettes. Once again, about <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2205904\">70% showed unconscious preferences towards white patients</a>.</p> <p>Do such biases affect how patients are treated? Multiple high-profile studies have suggested they do. In 2016, <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/03/30/1516047113.abstract\">a paper</a> in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences surveying 222 white medical students and residents found that 50% of them believed black patients felt less pain than white patients, and so required less medication. </p> <p>However in the trauma world, there remains a lack of acceptance, both that racial disparities exist and that bias is a problem at all. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522774\">survey published in 2016</a> of 536 surgeons found that 50% thought there was little evidence for disparities, and of the 50% who believed they did exist, 90% felt this was down to patient factors such as lack of compliance with treatment.</p> <p>\u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Haider says. \u201cWhen it comes to their hospital, it\u2019s a case of: \u2018we treat everybody the same, no issues here.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Global disparities</strong></h2> <p>As more and more evidence has emerged, researchers have begun to wonder about the extent to which disparities in trauma care exist in different nations. However, attempts to study racial disparities in healthcare in general have often faced considerable obstacles. In France, for instance, such research is prohibited, while in the UK, the NHS databases only contain a handful of demographic variables for each patient.

      "bodyText": "Ten years ago, when Dr Adil Haider, a trauma surgeon at Harvard Medical School, began investigating disparities in emergency centre outcomes based on information recorded in the US National Trauma Data Bank, he discovered a striking trend. In the US, trauma is the number one cause of death for people under 47, and Haider had identified huge differences in patient survival rates based entirely on race. Compared to white patients with injuries of similar severity, black and Hispanic patients were found to have 20% and 50% greater likelihoods of death respectively. While earlier studies had already noted racial disparities in cancer treatment, observing this in the world of trauma caused a particular stir. \u201cPeople have always had this iconic image of emergency departments as the great equalisers,\u201d Haider says. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that no matter who you are, if you have a trauma injury, you\u2019re going to get picked up and receive the same level of care.\u201d Haider\u2019s findings were based on data from 429,751 patients and 700 hospitals, yet they attracted outrage in certain quarters. \u201cI find the publication of this study extremely troublesome,\u201d one surgeon wrote in a letter. \u201cIt is an insult to those who provide trauma care.\u201d However despite this opposition, in recent years more and more research groups across the US have identified the same trend: a much greater likelihood of death for black or ethnic minority patients compared to white patients for the same traumatic injuries. There are some obvious initial explanations for these findings, one being the variety of socioeconomic factors tied in with health insurance. When Haider compared uninsured black patients to insured white patients, the black patients were 80% more likely to die. To unpick why this was the case, Haider and others in his field began to look at trauma centre rankings, which are based on scores called observed-to-expected mortality ratios. Trauma centres have developed a finely-tuned science of predicting an individual\u2019s chances of dying from a particular degree of injury, allowing them to calculate the proportion of patients who survive compared to the projections. Their studies showed that it tends to be the worst-performing trauma centres that take care of the vast majority of uninsured black and ethnic minority patients in inner-city areas. These centres are faced with a lot of highly complex, penetrative trauma cases, and because their patients typically lack insurance, they\u2019re faced with negative financial margins and few resources with which to improve their processes. \u201cThere\u2019s a vicious cycle which plays out,\u201d Haider says. \u201cFirst you have these struggling trauma centres which are already laden with a lot of patients without insurance, and then they get penalised because their outcomes are worse. And that makes it even more difficult for them to deliver the best care.\u201d But while the introduction of the Affordable Care Act has improved the accessibility of insurance, and reduced the strain on some centres, there\u2019s one crucial factor in trauma care which means the odds are still greatly stacked against black and minority patients from poorer communities: time. Trauma deserts In emergency medicine, time is one of the most crucial factors relating to survival. Paramedics say that the sooner a patient with a traumatic injury can be sent to a high-level centre, the greater the likelihood of preventing death. However, in the US, many of the best for-profit trauma centres have long sought to maximise their revenue streams by focusing on areas where the majority of patients have insurance. South Florida is one such example. With a large demographic of retired, insured, white people, trauma centres can make a lot of money from treating patients with traumatic injuries following falls, resulting in an abundance of care facilities. However, Chicago\u2019s often violent South Side, in which 93% of the population is black, has long faced a \u201ctrauma desert\u201d, after the main University of Chicago trauma unit closed down two decades ago due to financial strain. Despite widespread protests and studies suggesting that one in five patients could have been saved if they\u2019d received treatment quicker, there is still no level 1 trauma centre located in the area. In addition, Haider is convinced other factors are at play. When he compared black insured patients to white insured patients, black patients were still 20% more likely to die. \u201cBias from healthcare providers could also be an important factor,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that trauma happens to certain types of people, who deserve it because they\u2019re from the wrong side of town, and even well-meaning, highly qualified people end up falling into that bias.\u201d Of the one million people who have taken the online implicit association test \u2013 a social psychology experiment designed by psychologists at Harvard University to detect the automatic associations between different races/genders and certain concepts which are stored subconsciously \u2013 approximately 70% showed preferences towards white people. Haider conducted similar tests on doctors, trainee surgeons and nurses using clinical vignettes. Once again, about 70% showed unconscious preferences towards white patients. Do such biases affect how patients are treated? Multiple high-profile studies have suggested they do. In 2016, a paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences surveying 222 white medical students and residents found that 50% of them believed black patients felt less pain than white patients, and so required less medication. However in the trauma world, there remains a lack of acceptance, both that racial disparities exist and that bias is a problem at all. A survey published in 2016 of 536 surgeons found that 50% thought there was little evidence for disparities, and of the 50% who believed they did exist, 90% felt this was down to patient factors such as lack of compliance with treatment. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Haider says. \u201cWhen it comes to their hospital, it\u2019s a case of: \u2018we treat everybody the same, no issues here.\u2019\u201d Global disparities As more and more evidence has emerged, researchers have begun to wonder about the extent to which disparities in trauma care exist in different nations. However, attempts to study racial disparities in healthcare in general have often faced considerable obstacles. In France, for instance, such research is prohibited, while in the UK, the NHS databases only contain a handful of demographic variables for each patient. While age, gender, and postcode are commonly recorded, there\u2019s no uniform practice on recording ethnicity data, meaning the information often isn\u2019t available for researchers looking to conduct comparisons across large numbers of patients. Some researchers believe part of the reason ethnicity data is not recorded with the same rigour in the UK as in the US, making comparisons difficult, is because it\u2019s long been assumed in the NHS that any disparities which may exist in the US healthcare system are entirely associated with insurance. Because access to healthcare is universal in the UK, the NHS perception has been that disparities, particularly in trauma care, do not exist. However, in the past few years some studies have begun to emerge that suggest certain disparities are present in trauma care in the UK. At the University of Oxford, Dr David Metcalfe, an orthopaedic surgeon specialising in musculoskeletal trauma, has published a series of papers in the past two years looking at disparities in care for patients across the UK who had incurred hip fractures after falls. While these patients are considerably different to those studied by Haider - patients who had mostly suffered either penetrative traumas such as gunshot and stab wounds, or traumatic head injuries - Metcalfe\u2019s results indicated that patients from poorer backgrounds were far less likely to receive the best operation recommended by the guidelines. But unlike in the US, there wasn\u2019t any correlation between poorer outcomes and the worst-performing hospitals . Instead, Metcalfe believes the factors driving these differences might be more subtle. \u201cPatients from wealthier backgrounds may be able to advocate for themselves more effectively,\u201d he suggests. \u201cThey\u2019re also more likely to have three middle-class children who turn up that night to ask questions about what operation is being performed and why, whereas somebody from a different background may not have that same support network.\u201d Metcalfe believes that implicit bias may play a role in such decision-making. \u201cIn the emergency department, a good proportion of the patients we see are homeless or struggling with their social circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cObviously that background isn\u2019t reflected by the staff they\u2019re being treated by. As such, because surgical decision-making is very subjective, it\u2019s sometimes impossible to completely remove social judgment from clinical decisions. When you\u2019re looking at a patient who\u2019s malnourished, compared to another who\u2019s sat in a chair in their own clothes, this can lead to a very different decision on whether they\u2019ll tolerate a particular operation.\u201d However, other surgeons say that while it\u2019s accepted there are a number of cognitive biases which can interfere with clinical decision-making, this is just one component of many factors which are likely to lead to worse outcomes in patients from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cThe emergency room environment is a complex one where time-critical decisions must be made \u2013 often with only partial information,\u201d says Professor Karim Brohi, a trauma surgeon at Royal London Hospital and head of the trauma sciences research team at Barts and the London School of Medicine. \u201cSo surgeons may be susceptible to certain types of bias during these times and more and more clinicians are being taught about this. \u201cBut it\u2019s also important to remember that these patients often have poor underlying health and nutrition, are more likely to have underlying mental health problems, are less likely to re-present if there are complications.

      "bodyText": "The federal government has given at least in-principle support to all but two of the recommendations from the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory that it considers apply to commonwealth matters. The royal commission made more than 230 recommendations in its damning final report in November, of which only 28 come under federal or shared jurisdiction, the federal government has said. In a joint statement, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, Indigenous affairs minister Nigel Scullion, and social services minister Dan Tehan said the federal government was \u201ccommitted to taking action where appropriate\u201d but noted that \u201cthe majority of the findings and recommendations are matters for the Northern Territory government\u201d. Turnbull called the royal commission in July 2016 after a report by the ABC Four Corners program aired footage of horrific abuse in Don Dale youth detention centre. Ruth Barson, director of legal advocacy at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the commonwealth\u2019s response was \u201clargely abrogating responsibility\u201d. Among the recommendations deemed not a federal government responsibility were the call to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12; banning juvenile detention as an option for anyone under 14 except for serious crimes; and closing Don Dale youth detention centre. In a response released late Thursday, the federal government gave its full support to recommendations around developing a custody notification scheme \u2013 which Scullion has offered to fund \u2013 as well as establishing and participating in a tripartite forum with the territory government and community members to ensure a coordinated deployment of youth justice and child protection programs. It also gave in-principle support to conducting an audit of federal funding of family and child protection services in the territory; committing to a place-based approach for implementing the recommendations of the royal commission in consultation with local communities; and helping to establish and fund a network of 20 family support services to help families understand and navigate the child protection system. Recommendations around improving the unified national collection of data around key issues such as youth recidivism rates and children transitioning out of out-of-home care also received in-principle support, as did a recommendation that the NT supply Indigenous deaths in custody data and that the Australian Institute of Criminology publish that data annually. A recommendation that Medicare benefits be paid for health services administered to children in detention, including Medicare or national disability insurance scheme-funded foetal alcohol spectrum disorder assessments, was not supported on the grounds it would be double dipping, because the federal government already funded states to provide health services in prisons. It also did not support a recommendation to grant counsel assisting in a royal commission the power to compel witnesses, saying it was sufficient that royal commissioners had that power. Turnbull, Scullion and Tehan said they had committed to \u201cimproved national leadership and the coordination of early intervention for at-risk children\u201d. \u201cThe commonwealth is committed to improving partnership arrangements with the Northern Territory government to ensure investments achieve improved outcomes for children, and make the community a safer place for everyone,\u201d it said. The territory receives $4.2bn in federal funding, and has received $720m for programs directed at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through the oft-criticised Indigenous advancement strategy (IAS). Turnbull said his government had already committed $53m to evaluate its Indigenous affairs policies and funded programs, including the IAS. The statement also extended the offer of three years\u2019 funding for a legislated custody notification service to other states and territories, saying it had written to all jurisdictions and \u201cwe strongly encourage them to accept our offer\u201d. Western Australia and South Australia have said they are considering the funding offer but have not made any announcements.",

      "body": "<p>It came to me \u2013 in a flash of brilliance \u2013 while watching the first episode of the Walter Presents Swedish crime drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/before-we-die-review-britains-favourite-dogs-top-100\">Before We Die</a>. Our hero, grumpy cop Hanna, is chasing the black pick-up \u2013 in which her colleague (and lover) Sven is tied up \u2013 in her Volvo estate. Being a Volvo estate, it\u2019s obviously not going to set anyone\u2019s pants on fire, but it\u2019s safe and reliable, and accelerates steadily through the gears and the bleak Nordic landscape, until it\u2019s flying \u2013 literally as it happens \u2013 off the road and into a field. And this is pretty much exactly what happens with Before We Die: it\u2019s a reliable Scandi drama that doesn\u2019t screech away from the lights but gains in pace and powerful momentum. Do you see? It is a Volvo estate of a drama. And all you need is few more examples and you have yourself a theory: you can tell what kind of drama it is simply by looking at the cars that appear in it.</p> <h2>The Crown \u2013 Rolls-Royce Phantom III</h2> <p>There are lots of lovely vintage motors in the top-of-the-range Netflix show, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/05/watching-the-wheels-readers-share-their-land-rover-defender-stories\">Series 1 Land Rovers</a>, Humbers and Rileys. But the four-wheeled star (five if you count the side-mounted spare) is the 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III in burgundy and black. It is stately in pace, and quiet, but with plenty of power when required. Beautifully crafted, expensive, but not ostentatious and showy. Who cares if Queen Elizabeth didn\u2019t actually have a Phantom III? Hers was \u2013 still is \u2013 a 1950 Phantom IV. The racier moments in series two of The Crown, involving Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, are echoed in their own chosen transport, a beautiful vintage Triumph motorcycle, astride which they fly through London.</p> <h2>Maltese \u2013 Alfa Romeo Giulia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"005a6670ad2678d690d7266254063d0e131bc5a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/005a6670ad2678d690d7266254063d0e131bc5a5/0_124_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Alfa Romeos go beautifully with detective Maltese\u2019s moustache.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Alfa Romeos go beautifully with detective Maltese\u2019s moustache.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrizio Di Giulio/Fabrizio Di Diulio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is another in the Channel 4 Walter Presents slot, though this time brought from sunnier Mediterranean climes: Sicily of the 1970s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/01/maltese-mafia-drama-exposes-era-when-sicilian-mob-reigned-in-blood\">the golden age of Cosa Nostra</a>. Hotter cars than Hanna\u2019s Volvo, too. There are lots of cars to excite the nostalgic enthusiast in Maltese: Lancias, Minis and Beetles, big black Mercedes taxis. But the stand-out stars are the Alfa Romeos. The title character, detective Dario Maltese, drives one, a boxy black Giulia, and it goes so very well with his moustache. Unreliable (is that the car backfiring or someone getting shot?), unpredictable, but sexy, and fun \u2013 the car, the man, the show. Will you stick with it? Who knows, but why not enjoy it for the moment?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/18/the-bridge-porsche-cult-status\">The Bridge fans elevate detective Saga's Porsche to cult following</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The Bridge \u2013 Porsche 911S (1977)</h2> <p>This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/18/the-bridge-porsche-cult-status\">olive-coloured icon has almost as many fans as the Scandi drama</a> it appears in.

The car\u2019s handling wasn\u2019t the smoothest, though. A review <a href=\"https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1977-porsche-911s-archived-road-test-review\">at the time</a> of its release described cornering thus: \u201cThe inside front tire was high in the air, the outside front was grinding with understeer and both rear tires were alternately sticking and sliding wide.\u201d That slightly unhinged nature is a perfect fit for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/12/the-bridge-sofia-helin-being-saga-noren-interview\">police sleuth who doesn\u2019t care for social graces</a> or giving her co-pilots a smooth ride.</p> <h2>Endeavour \u2013 Mark I Jaguar</h2> <p>Of course, Morse famously drove a red Mark II Jaguar. But in Russell Lewis\u2019s prequel, which has just started its fifth series on ITV, Shaun Evans\u2019s young Endeavour Morse and Roger Allam\u2019s Inspector Fred Thursday glide around town \u2013 you know which one \u2013 in a black Mark I. That works \u2013 Mark I Morse in a Mark I Jag. Same idea, just earlier version thereof and less colourful. And what would you expect from a drama featuring either model? Classy but neither very exciting nor innovative. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/feb/05/endeavour-review-as-comforting-as-cheese-on-toast\">Conservative, quintessentially English</a> ...

He and rebellious classmate Alyssa, set off together; who knows where to, who knows why \u2013 James thinks he\u2019s a psychopath and is intending to kill her. The car, a beige-coloured 1980s 230E Mercedes, which did seem to be a perfect dad car, immediately becomes incredibly cool: the perfect car in which to set off on a surreal road trip. Even the colour is right \u2013 murky and uncertain, open to interpretation. They write it off in the second episode, and have to continue their adventure by other means, but while it lasted, it was perfect. Watch TEotFW btw, if you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s brilliant.</p> <h2>Love \u2013 Mercedes W114</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cd4547b168ec0e8e7d3c78dd5932367f3b131741\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd4547b168ec0e8e7d3c78dd5932367f3b131741/0_290_6316_3791/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Classy looks and 70s luxury \u2026 the Mercedes in Love.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classy looks and 70s luxury \u2026 the Mercedes in Love.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Hanover/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of cars that are ideal for douches, or hipsters at least, the German workhorse \u2013 favoured by dictators in the 1970s \u2013 has a special place in the TV car pantheon. In Love, Mickey drives around in one of these while Gus, mopes around southern California in the other ubiquitous LA vehicle, a Toyota Prius. You could argue the instinctive and unpredictable Mickey suits the 70s cool of the Merc, while Gus is far too buttoned-up to ever risk driving anything other than a hybrid. The annoying nature of Love\u2019s characters has been widely noted, but Mickey\u2019s car, with it\u2019s simple but classy looks and 70s luxury, makes the whole package a lot more palatable.</p> <h2><br></h2>",

Our hero, grumpy cop Hanna, is chasing the black pick-up \u2013 in which her colleague (and lover) Sven is tied up \u2013 in her Volvo estate. Being a Volvo estate, it\u2019s obviously not going to set anyone\u2019s pants on fire, but it\u2019s safe and reliable, and accelerates steadily through the gears and the bleak Nordic landscape, until it\u2019s flying \u2013 literally as it happens \u2013 off the road and into a field. And this is pretty much exactly what happens with Before We Die: it\u2019s a reliable Scandi drama that doesn\u2019t screech away from the lights but gains in pace and powerful momentum. Do you see? It is a Volvo estate of a drama. And all you need is few more examples and you have yourself a theory: you can tell what kind of drama it is simply by looking at the cars that appear in it. The Crown \u2013 Rolls-Royce Phantom III There are lots of lovely vintage motors in the top-of-the-range Netflix show, including Series 1 Land Rovers, Humbers and Rileys. But the four-wheeled star (five if you count the side-mounted spare) is the 1937 Rolls-Royce Phantom III in burgundy and black. It is stately in pace, and quiet, but with plenty of power when required. Beautifully crafted, expensive, but not ostentatious and showy. Who cares if Queen Elizabeth didn\u2019t actually have a Phantom III? Hers was \u2013 still is \u2013 a 1950 Phantom IV. The racier moments in series two of The Crown, involving Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, are echoed in their own chosen transport, a beautiful vintage Triumph motorcycle, astride which they fly through London. Maltese \u2013 Alfa Romeo Giulia This is another in the Channel 4 Walter Presents slot, though this time brought from sunnier Mediterranean climes: Sicily of the 1970s, the golden age of Cosa Nostra. Hotter cars than Hanna\u2019s Volvo, too. There are lots of cars to excite the nostalgic enthusiast in Maltese: Lancias, Minis and Beetles, big black Mercedes taxis. But the stand-out stars are the Alfa Romeos. The title character, detective Dario Maltese, drives one, a boxy black Giulia, and it goes so very well with his moustache. Unreliable (is that the car backfiring or someone getting shot?), unpredictable, but sexy, and fun \u2013 the car, the man, the show. Will you stick with it? Who knows, but why not enjoy it for the moment? The Bridge \u2013 Porsche 911S (1977) This olive-coloured icon has almost as many fans as the Scandi drama it appears in. There are multiple online forums dedicated to figuring out what model of Porsche it is: we think it\u2019s a 1977 Porsche 911S. Either way, Saga Nor\u00e9n\u2019s difficult but talented detective bombs around murder and abduction cases in a car that\u2019s more sculpture than motor vehicle. The car\u2019s handling wasn\u2019t the smoothest, though. A review at the time of its release described cornering thus: \u201cThe inside front tire was high in the air, the outside front was grinding with understeer and both rear tires were alternately sticking and sliding wide.\u201d That slightly unhinged nature is a perfect fit for a police sleuth who doesn\u2019t care for social graces or giving her co-pilots a smooth ride. Endeavour \u2013 Mark I Jaguar Of course, Morse famously drove a red Mark II Jaguar. But in Russell Lewis\u2019s prequel, which has just started its fifth series on ITV, Shaun Evans\u2019s young Endeavour Morse and Roger Allam\u2019s Inspector Fred Thursday glide around town \u2013 you know which one \u2013 in a black Mark I. That works \u2013 Mark I Morse in a Mark I Jag. Same idea, just earlier version thereof and less colourful. And what would you expect from a drama featuring either model? Classy but neither very exciting nor innovative. Conservative, quintessentially English ... Hey, like Hanna\u2019s Volvo, our theory gains momentum. The End of the F***ing World \u2013 Mercedes W123 (230E) At the end of the first episode of this wonderful dark comedy, 17-year-old James walks up to his douche dad, punches him in the face, and nicks his car. He and rebellious classmate Alyssa, set off together; who knows where to, who knows why \u2013 James thinks he\u2019s a psychopath and is intending to kill her. The car, a beige-coloured 1980s 230E Mercedes, which did seem to be a perfect dad car, immediately becomes incredibly cool: the perfect car in which to set off on a surreal road trip. Even the colour is right \u2013 murky and uncertain, open to interpretation. They write it off in the second episode, and have to continue their adventure by other means, but while it lasted, it was perfect. Watch TEotFW btw, if you haven\u2019t already, it\u2019s brilliant. Love \u2013 Mercedes W114 Speaking of cars that are ideal for douches, or hipsters at least, the German workhorse \u2013 favoured by dictators in the 1970s \u2013 has a special place in the TV car pantheon. In Love, Mickey drives around in one of these while Gus, mopes around southern California in the other ubiquitous LA vehicle, a Toyota Prius. You could argue the instinctive and unpredictable Mickey suits the 70s cool of the Merc, while Gus is far too buttoned-up to ever risk driving anything other than a hybrid. The annoying nature of Love\u2019s characters has been widely noted, but Mickey\u2019s car, with it\u2019s simple but classy looks and 70s luxury, makes the whole package a lot more palatable.",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has brushed off claims the federal government has ditched the Closing the Gap strategy to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians, saying it is expanding the program and devoting more money to the cause. A damning report by the Close the Gap campaign accused successive governments of poorly implementing and \u201ceffectively abandoning\u201d the 25-year strategy to achieve health parity by 2030, highlighting in particular the Abbott government\u2019s $530m cut to Indigenous affairs in the 2014 budget. The campaign, which was the push behind the formation of the Closing the Gap strategy 10 years ago, held its annual breakfast in Canberra on Thursday. It said the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians had widened in the 10 years since the policy was introduced and that without a dramatic overhaul to address structural issues underlying health inequality in Australia, the Closing the Gap targets would \u201cmeasure nothing but the collective failure of Australian governments to work together and to stay the course\u201d. Turnbull attended the breakfast but was criticised for leaving shortly after Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commissioner June Oscar\u2019s speech, even though his early exit had been prearranged. Speaking in parliament later, he defended his government\u2019s handling of Indigenous affairs. \u201cThe proposition that the government is cutting funding for Indigenous affairs is simply wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are putting more resources into Indigenous advancement all the time.\u201d Labor senator Pat Dodson condemned Turnbull\u2019s decision to leave the meeting early, saying he hoped it drew international criticism. \u201cThis is the leader of our country, and this is a major event, this is an international event,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cThis will go overseas, and if anyone focused on the leader of this nation walking out on a major report by reputable Aboriginal leaders, they\u2019d have to think, well, we really do feel for the Indigenous people.\u201d The federal government is in the process of \u201crefreshing\u201d the Closing the Gap strategy, with four of the seven targets due to expire this year. Only one target \u2013 to halve the gap in year 12 attainment rates by 2020 \u2013 is currently on track. More than 60 Indigenous delegates from every state and territory met in Canberra this week to discuss the proposed changes, with delegates telling Guardian Australia that attempts to broaden the discussion to look at structural issues both with the policy and in society had been hemmed in by members of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who narrowed the conversation to focus on what additional targets might be added. The refresh is a key item on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Friday. Dodson and fellow Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy criticised the government for not including Labor or the crossbenchers in the refresh discussions, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to be committing to.\u201d \u201cBipartisanship is always what Close the Gap was all about,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe one day of the parliamentary year where our country and all representatives in the parliament would focus on First Nations issues in this country \u2026 it\u2019s an absolute disgrace that you have Indigenous members in this parliament who were not included, who were not invited, who have not been briefed on anything to do with Close the Gap.\u201d",

Did she accept submissions from powerful irrigator lobbyists after public consultation had finished? And did these same cotton irrigators receive 32% more water while she was water minister?\u201d The Guardian revealed on Thursday that a key irrigation lobbyist representing large irrigators around Bourke, Ian Cole, continued to lobby the minister after the public consultations on the plan had closed and that further changes were made by the minister to make the plan more favourable to irrigators. Meanwhile, in Canberra, the move by the Greens to block an amendment to the northern basin plan that includes the Barwon-Darling, has prompted a warning from the water minister, David Littleproud, that the the entire Murray-Darling basin plan could \u201cunravel\u201d . Sussan Ley, the Liberal member for Farrer, which covers the Murrumbidgee and Murray valleys, said in parliament she was prepared to encourage NSW and Victoria to leave the plan if her community was forced to make more water savings. Labor appears willing to horse trade on the 70-gigalitre cut to the northern basin plan for more solid commitments from the Turnbull government on the southern basin. Labor\u2019s water spokesman, Tony Burke, is trying to obtain written and legislative commitments from the government on proposals to increase flows to the southern basin, which include an additional 450GL of \u201cdown\u201d water for South Australia by 2024. Labor wants the 450GL linked in legislation to a plan to deliver 605GL of \u201cupwater\u201d through efficiency projects to be funded by the commonwealth. These include farm projects to make more efficient use of water. In a letter, Burke says if the water savings don\u2019t materialise Labor wants \u201ca written commitment that \u2026 the commonwealth would take responsibility to deliver the 450GL\u201d. With the South Australian election campaign in full swing and a byelection in the federal seat of Batman in Melbourne on 17 March, a \u201cwin\u201d on water policy would be a big boost to Labor. Labor faces a tough challenge from the Greens in Batman and polls have indicated that Labor is behind in South Australia, though the intervention of Nick Xenophon\u2019s SA Best party makes the outcome more difficult to predict. In return, Labor is offering to delay the disallowance vote in the northern basin on the 70GL cut. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority issued another defence of its plan to cut the target for environmental water recovery by 70GL or 18%, saying it was based on sound science, and disputed the findings of the Australia Institute. Water policy has become highly contentious once again. The government is attempting to legislate changes to the plan, which are backed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, but environmentalists and scientists say the current plan is already compromised by the way the states have implemented it and that it is failing. The large number of documents obtained by the Guardian detail the bureaucratic processes in forming the controversial Barwon-Darling plan and raise questions about the fairness of the process. A draft letter to Cole to be sent from Hodgkinson acknowledges that late changes were made in 2012. \u201cFollowing consideration of a number of WSP matters raised with me, I requested the Office of Water to make several amendments which, I believe, now present a fair and equitable outcome for all.\u201d Hodgkinson announced her resignation from parliament within days of a Four Corners program going to air in July last year.

The LGA estimates that they face a \u00a35bn funding gap by 2020, which could potentially push many councils to breaking point. <br></p> <p>The LGIU survey analysed responses from about 113 individual county, district and unitary councils \u2013 around one third of the total in England. Nearly 70% of those that responded are under Conservative control.<br></p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to good-quality care and we recognise there are challenges \u2013 that\u2019s why we will shortly publish a health and care workforce strategy to address these issues.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Local authorities in England are teetering on the edge of a financial crisis, with most planning to increase council tax from April while continuing to cut services, a survey has found. The annual finance survey from the Local Government Information Unit thinktank (LGIU) comes days after Northamptonshire county council became the first town hall in two decades to declare effective bankruptcy. Severe financial pressures had left the council unable deliver a workable budget. The LGIU warned that the Northamptonshire crisis was potentially the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, with four-fifths of councils concerned about their financial sustainability amid uncertainty over funding and the accelerating costs of social care. \u201cCouncils are on the edge. They are, for the most part, holding services together \u2013 although a significant minority are not. But they can only do this by raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves,\u201d said Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the LGIU. Lord Porter, the Conservative chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), said the survey showed some councils were being pushed \u201cperilously close to the financial edge\u201d, adding that many more would face huge challenges in setting budgets for the coming year. \u201cExtra council-tax-raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income, but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.\u201d Local Tory MPs and Labour politicians have called for Northamptonshire to be taken over by government commissioners. The council forecasts a \u00a321m overspend for the current year, and has warned that its finances will remain \u201cgrave\u201d in the near future as it struggles to make \u00a334m of cuts on top of the \u00a3376m made since 2010. Earlier this week, ministers sought to head off a rebellion by backbench Tory MPs in shire areas by announcing an additional \u00a3150m of funding for adult social care in 2018-19, together with extra cash for rural areas. However, critics warned this was inadequate to meet long-term pressures. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cOur finance settlement strikes a balance between relieving growing pressure on local government while ensuring that hard-pressed taxpayers do not face excessive bills. \u201cWe have listened to representations made from councils and delivered on these with extra funding. Overall, councils will see a real-term increase in resources over the next two years, more freedom and fairness, and with a greater certainty to plan and secure value for money.\u201d The problems facing local authorities are underlined by a National Audit Office (NAO) report that says England faces a recruitment crisis in social care, driven by poor wages and working conditions. It says current low rates of recruitment will not meet the estimated need for between 350,000 and 700,000 extra care workers by 2030. Ministers have no up-to-date workforce strategy and have effectively ignored the growing crisis in social care staffing, the NAO report concludes. It says workforce planning is difficult while there remains little clarity about the sustainability of local authority spending on social care, which has fallen by 5.3% since 2010. Brexit barriers on overseas workers could exacerbate the care worker shortage, the report suggests. There were 95,000 non-British European Economic Area nationals working in care in 2016-17, equivalent to 7% of the total workforce, although this rises to as much as 20% in parts of London and the south-east. Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said: \u201cThe NAO\u2019s report shows the social care workforce is in a precarious state. We are increasingly dependent on care workers to look after ourselves and our families, yet the profession suffers from low pay, low esteem and high turnover of staff.\u201d The LGIU survey found spiralling demand for adult social care remained the greatest long-term pressure on council budgets, although a third of councils now say children\u2019s social services funding is the biggest short-term challenge, fuelled by rising numbers of children being taken into care. The thinktank said the vast majority of councils planned to make ends meet in 2018-19 by increasing council tax and drawing on \u201crainy day\u201d financial reserves, as well as raising or introducing charges for services including parking, garden waste disposal, burial, planning, home care and meals on wheels. Some of the respondents to the survey said charges would rise above inflation. One said charges would be imposed \u201cwherever we can\u201d. Another said parish councils would be asked to see if local residents would fund services such as grass cutting on roadside verges, youth clubs and street lighting. \u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d one respondent said, adding: \u201cWe pay for parking \u2013 why not pay for [access to] domestic waste sites, bus passes, etc?\u201d At the same time, many councils admit they are planning to reduce services further, with over half aiming to cut spending on parks and leisure centres, and a third lining up cuts \u2013 or further cuts \u2013 to social care, youth centres, libraries, art galleries and museums. Almost all councils (95%) say they are planning to raise council tax this year \u2013 a far cry from 2012, when the same proportion froze rates, encouraged by ministers. Many councils plan to increase council tax by 6% in 2018-19 \u2013 the maximum allowed \u2013 including 3% earmarked to fund social care. With conventional funding sources shrinking, three-quarters of councils say they are considering investing in local commercial property developments, commercialising council services or buying investment properties as a way of generating cash. England\u2019s councils have experienced a 40% cut in their funding from central government since the start of the decade. The LGA estimates that they face a \u00a35bn funding gap by 2020, which could potentially push many councils to breaking point. The LGIU survey analysed responses from about 113 individual county, district and unitary councils \u2013 around one third of the total in England. Nearly 70% of those that responded are under Conservative control. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to good-quality care and we recognise there are challenges \u2013 that\u2019s why we will shortly publish a health and care workforce strategy to address these issues.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When playwright Frances Poet ventured out alone as a child she knew her father would sometimes secretly follow her to keep her safe. He had good reason, having previously suffered the loss of a child.</p> <p>Now she is a mother herself, Poet understands the constant drip of parental anxiety: the desire to let your children climb and the dread that they will fall, their injuries a punishment for your negligent parenting.</p> <p>Poet writes about how safeguarding turns to suffocation in her play Gut, which opens at the Traverse in Edinburgh in April. Maddy is a happy, apparently confident working mother who suddenly starts finding danger in every shadow after an incident at the supermarket, which occurs when her young son is with his grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like I opened a door in my mind and now I can\u2019t shut it,\u201d says Maddy, as her fears escalate. The play asks who you should trust, and I read it with the same hurtling sense of dread that I read Le\u00efla Slimani\u2019s bestseller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/26/leila-slimani-lullaby-interview\">Lullaby</a>, about a nanny who kills her charges.</p> <p>Maddy\u2019s parenting anxieties are contrasted with the more laid-back approach of her mother-in-law. \u201cI think we are a generation of parents who are plagued with self-doubt,\u201d says Poet, who points a finger at parenting gurus such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jan/11/nick-clegg-gina-ford\">Gina Ford</a>, \u201ca woman whose books encourage you to ignore your parental gut instinct about what is best for you and your child\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdd89702f09b86ad8778640eefda4f4a60bc58c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd89702f09b86ad8778640eefda4f4a60bc58c1/0_121_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Dolan: \u2018Blaming a mother is something we all do.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Dolan: \u2018Blaming a mother is something we all do.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bronwen Sharp</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Poet likes to think of Maddy as an unexceptional woman who finds herself in a perfect storm of unfortunate events that make her behave in extreme ways. \u201cI see her as an everywoman, someone just like us. We are susceptible because, as the old support systems have broken down, the pressures on parents become greater. I don\u2019t think that parenting has always been this traumatic, isolating thing that my generation is often finding it.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/oct/18/monica-dolan-interview-w1a-plaques-and-tangles-alzheimers\">Monica Dolan</a>, whose hit Edinburgh solo show The B*easts opens at the Bush theatre in London this week, also believes that today\u2019s parents are under significant pressure. \u201cThere is so much insecurity attached to parenting, and so much guilt, too, if you don\u2019t give children what they want,\u201d she says. But what if what your child wants is not in their best interests? In The B*easts, what eight-year-old Leila wants is a pair of breasts. Her mother, Karen, obliges, creating tabloid headlines in the very same papers who promote sexualised images of young women every day.</p> <p>Dolan also performs her smartly intelligent and searching monologue, playing a therapist, Tessa, who has been brought in to treat Karen in the wake of the scandal. \u201cBlaming a mother is something we all do. We read those stories and go: \u2018How could she?\u2019\u201d One of the things I wanted to challenge was how people looked at Karen and judged the choices that she makes. We all have a responsibility for the environment we create for parents.\u201d</p> <p>Like Josh Azouz\u2019s Buggy Baby \u2013 which opens at the Yard next month, and which features two parents struggling for air in a room where an outsized baby (played by an adult) uses up all the oxygen \u2013 both Gut and The B*easts are about more than just parenting. But Azouz says that Buggy Baby also reflects the power dynamics between parents and children, and how the child casts both a spell and a curse over the parents. \u201cPeople and relationships are always changed by the arrival of a baby,\u201d says Azouz who recently became a father himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a609d5b08983a3503648bd95b80a127491fe128d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a609d5b08983a3503648bd95b80a127491fe128d/0_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matilda Leyser in Line, Point, Plane at the Linbury Studio, Royal Opera House, in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matilda Leyser in Line, Point, Plane at the Linbury Studio, Royal Opera House, in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These plays are part of a growing body of works such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/24/theatre-unemployment-tangled-feet\">Tangled Feet</a>\u2019s Kicking and Screaming and Nina Segal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/09/in-the-night-time-before-the-sun-rises-review-terrors-parenthood-nina-segal\">In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises)</a> that put parental experience and anxieties centre stage. At the Donmar in London last year, the actors Rosalie Craig and Michelle Terry put on a workshop piece, <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/production/6305/becoming-part-one/\">Becoming: Part One</a>. It was inspired by their desire, as new parents, to explore how theatre might allow them to be both artists and mothers. The same impetus led Matilda Leyser to set up <a href=\"http://www.improbable.co.uk/motherswhomake/\">Mothers Who Make</a>, a support organisation for women who are both artists and parents.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who think that being a mother and being an artist are profoundly incompatible are still surprisingly prevalent in theatre,\u201d says Leyser. She points out that, while theatre constantly borrows from the language of motherhood, including the idea of \u201cgiving birth to a project\u201d, it has often been less than receptive to shows exploring parenthood.</p> <p>A former aerialist, Leyser made a piece Me, Mother that was performed the Roundhouse Circusfest in 2016, but it was not without a struggle. Along the way she encountered many who dismissed it as too niche, and said the only people who would want to see it were other mothers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c87fa50d3efaa204922fab393af982a15edf17f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c87fa50d3efaa204922fab393af982a15edf17f9/0_331_3162_3948/801.jpg\" alt=\"Caiolfhionn Dunne in Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel at the Gate in 2017.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caiolfhionn Dunne in Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel at the Gate in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anna Ehnold-Danailov, one of the co-founders of <a href=\"http://www.pipacampaign.com/\">Parents in Performing Arts</a> , also runs her own company, Prams in the Hall, which allows practitioners to bring their children into the rehearsal room. She believes that one of the reasons for the lack of plays about parenthood is that programmers and critics have historically been dismissive of plays that they see as being domestic.</p> <p>However, as Magali Mougel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/01/suzy-storck-review-gate-theatre-london\">Suzy Storck</a> at the Gate proved recently, plays about parenting can be as much a reflection of society and cultural shifts as those about the machinations of Westminster or the financial crisis. </p> <p>As Leyser observes: \u201cWhen I became a mother I was gobsmacked by how little it was valued, how much hard work it is and how political it is.\u201d Poet echoes that sentiment. \u201cThe domestic is perceived as small but it\u2019s not, it gets to the heart of how people live their daily lives,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Ehnold-Danailov believes that we are starting to see more of this work partly because of the increasing number of younger women who are writing plays and making theatre. </p> <p>Poet says that in the last five years she has seen attitudes change (\u201cI\u2019m no longer apologetic about needing childcare\u201d) but nonetheless she needed to give herself permission to write Gut, a play about \u201cthe world I was living and breathing and the challenges around parenting that I was obsessing about\u201d.</p> <p>She says she owes her career to becoming a parent.

      "bodyText": "When playwright Frances Poet ventured out alone as a child she knew her father would sometimes secretly follow her to keep her safe. He had good reason, having previously suffered the loss of a child. Now she is a mother herself, Poet understands the constant drip of parental anxiety: the desire to let your children climb and the dread that they will fall, their injuries a punishment for your negligent parenting. Poet writes about how safeguarding turns to suffocation in her play Gut, which opens at the Traverse in Edinburgh in April. Maddy is a happy, apparently confident working mother who suddenly starts finding danger in every shadow after an incident at the supermarket, which occurs when her young son is with his grandmother. \u201cIt\u2019s like I opened a door in my mind and now I can\u2019t shut it,\u201d says Maddy, as her fears escalate. The play asks who you should trust, and I read it with the same hurtling sense of dread that I read Le\u00efla Slimani\u2019s bestseller Lullaby, about a nanny who kills her charges. Maddy\u2019s parenting anxieties are contrasted with the more laid-back approach of her mother-in-law. \u201cI think we are a generation of parents who are plagued with self-doubt,\u201d says Poet, who points a finger at parenting gurus such as Gina Ford, \u201ca woman whose books encourage you to ignore your parental gut instinct about what is best for you and your child\u201d. Poet likes to think of Maddy as an unexceptional woman who finds herself in a perfect storm of unfortunate events that make her behave in extreme ways. \u201cI see her as an everywoman, someone just like us. We are susceptible because, as the old support systems have broken down, the pressures on parents become greater. I don\u2019t think that parenting has always been this traumatic, isolating thing that my generation is often finding it.\u201d Monica Dolan, whose hit Edinburgh solo show The B*easts opens at the Bush theatre in London this week, also believes that today\u2019s parents are under significant pressure. \u201cThere is so much insecurity attached to parenting, and so much guilt, too, if you don\u2019t give children what they want,\u201d she says. But what if what your child wants is not in their best interests? In The B*easts, what eight-year-old Leila wants is a pair of breasts. Her mother, Karen, obliges, creating tabloid headlines in the very same papers who promote sexualised images of young women every day. Dolan also performs her smartly intelligent and searching monologue, playing a therapist, Tessa, who has been brought in to treat Karen in the wake of the scandal. \u201cBlaming a mother is something we all do. We read those stories and go: \u2018How could she?\u2019\u201d One of the things I wanted to challenge was how people looked at Karen and judged the choices that she makes. We all have a responsibility for the environment we create for parents.\u201d Like Josh Azouz\u2019s Buggy Baby \u2013 which opens at the Yard next month, and which features two parents struggling for air in a room where an outsized baby (played by an adult) uses up all the oxygen \u2013 both Gut and The B*easts are about more than just parenting. But Azouz says that Buggy Baby also reflects the power dynamics between parents and children, and how the child casts both a spell and a curse over the parents. \u201cPeople and relationships are always changed by the arrival of a baby,\u201d says Azouz who recently became a father himself. These plays are part of a growing body of works such as Tangled Feet\u2019s Kicking and Screaming and Nina Segal\u2019s In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises) that put parental experience and anxieties centre stage. At the Donmar in London last year, the actors Rosalie Craig and Michelle Terry put on a workshop piece, Becoming: Part One. It was inspired by their desire, as new parents, to explore how theatre might allow them to be both artists and mothers. The same impetus led Matilda Leyser to set up Mothers Who Make, a support organisation for women who are both artists and parents. \u201cPeople who think that being a mother and being an artist are profoundly incompatible are still surprisingly prevalent in theatre,\u201d says Leyser. She points out that, while theatre constantly borrows from the language of motherhood, including the idea of \u201cgiving birth to a project\u201d, it has often been less than receptive to shows exploring parenthood. A former aerialist, Leyser made a piece Me, Mother that was performed the Roundhouse Circusfest in 2016, but it was not without a struggle. Along the way she encountered many who dismissed it as too niche, and said the only people who would want to see it were other mothers. Anna Ehnold-Danailov, one of the co-founders of Parents in Performing Arts , also runs her own company, Prams in the Hall, which allows practitioners to bring their children into the rehearsal room. She believes that one of the reasons for the lack of plays about parenthood is that programmers and critics have historically been dismissive of plays that they see as being domestic. However, as Magali Mougel\u2019s Suzy Storck at the Gate proved recently, plays about parenting can be as much a reflection of society and cultural shifts as those about the machinations of Westminster or the financial crisis. As Leyser observes: \u201cWhen I became a mother I was gobsmacked by how little it was valued, how much hard work it is and how political it is.\u201d Poet echoes that sentiment. \u201cThe domestic is perceived as small but it\u2019s not, it gets to the heart of how people live their daily lives,\u201d she says. Ehnold-Danailov believes that we are starting to see more of this work partly because of the increasing number of younger women who are writing plays and making theatre. Poet says that in the last five years she has seen attitudes change (\u201cI\u2019m no longer apologetic about needing childcare\u201d) but nonetheless she needed to give herself permission to write Gut, a play about \u201cthe world I was living and breathing and the challenges around parenting that I was obsessing about\u201d. She says she owes her career to becoming a parent. Before she had her first child she was a literary manager, and she only really started to write in earnest after the birth of her son. \u201cFor me, parenthood was the beginning of creativity. It has opened doors for me,\u201d she says. Proof that, contrary to Cyril Connolly\u2019s claim, the pram in the hall is not the enemy of good art.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Town halls to charge more \u2018wherever we can\u2019 Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray with your first sample of the news on a Thursday morning. Councils in England are being slammed by costs, with 95% planning to increase council tax this year and impose charges \u201cwherever we can\u201d \u2013 parking, waste disposal, burial, home care, meals on wheels \u2013 as well as cutting services such as libraries and parks. Northamptonshire council has effectively declared bankruptcy and that could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d, warns the Local Government Information Unit thinktank, which says four-fifths of councils are uncertain about their finances. Many local authorities plan to increase council tax by 6%, the maximum allowed. \u201cCouncils are on the edge,\u201d said Jonathan Carr-West, the unit\u2019s CEO, adding that they can only hold services together by \u201craising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves\u201d. The survey found adult social care is the greatest long-term pressure on council budgets, while children\u2019s social services are suffering from rising numbers having to be taken into care. Separately, the government\u2019s secret Brexit analysis suggests a no-deal scenario would blow an \u00a380bn hole in the public finances. MPs who have seen the documents say they show every region of the UK will be affected negatively whatever the deal. * * * Stonehenge tunnel unveiled \u2013 Plans for the \u00a31.6bn Stonehenge tunnel go on public display today, with the underground bypass slightly lengthened to just under two miles. That will preserve burial mounds and avoid disturbing a winter solstice view of the setting sun. Highways England says taking the A303 underground will reconnect the two halves of Stonehenge, and construction would start in 2021, with completion in 2025. English Heritage, the National Trust and Historic England support the concept but have expressed concern that will also relink several ancient byways, which might encourage 4x4 traffic and even camping near the site. The Stonehenge Alliance of archaeologists and environmental campaigners has called the plan an \u201cinternational scandal\u201d while the archaeological charity Rescue said: \u201cOur government proposes to spend \u00a31.6bn trashing a world heritage site.\u201d * * * \u2018Girls in fetish gear\u2019 at conference \u2013 Gambling companies have failed very badly to read the room, going ahead with a major exhibition in London that featured promotional women parading in lingerie and performing pole-dancing shows. The ICE Totally Gaming event at London\u2019s Excel centre comes after the President\u2019s Club scandal that led to the winding-up of the charity behind it. Labour\u2019s Tom Watson said: \u201cYou\u2019d expect even the most unreconstructed businesses to realise they should stop treating women as objects \u2013 but it seems this industry is ignorant enough not to clean up its act.\u201d Meanwhile a leaked survey has revealed that one in five workers at Westminster claims to have witnessed or been affected by sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour. A full report is due to be published today. * * * Gay marriage overturned \u2013 There has been a big backward step for equality in the British territory of Bermuda, where the Queen\u2019s viceroy has signed the repeal of same-sex marriage legislation. \u201cGovernor [John] Rankin and the Bermuda parliament have shamefully made Bermuda the first national territory in the world to repeal marriage equality,\u201d said Ty Cobb, director of Human Rights Campaign Global. Marriage for same-sex couples has now been replaced by registered domestic partnerships after an outcry from the island\u2019s social conservatives. \u201cI feel enormously disappointed,\u201d said 64-year-old married gay Bermudian Joe Gibbons. \u201cThis is not equality, and the British government has obviously just said, \u2018This is not our fight.\u2019\u201d * * * Slow start to 2018 home sales \u2013 New buyer inquiries fell for a 10th successive month in January in the UK while the number of houses newly listed by estate agents slipped back to the record lows of mid-2017. In its survey of estate agents, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) says house prices are expected to stay roughly flat in the coming three months. Prices have been edging upwards at a national level according to the survey, but have fallen in London, the south-east, East Anglia and the north-east. Prices have gone up most strongly in the north-west of England, Northern Ireland and Wales. More than half of homes valued over \u00a3500,000 are being sold below asking price, according to the Rics survey. * * * Health news in brief \u2013 We\u2019ve done housing so let\u2019s cover that other staple news round this morning: &gt; Anti-obesity programmes in schools may not be the answer to the problem. About 1,400 children in West Midlands schools were put through a year of extra physical activity sessions and healthy cooking classes but there was no improvement. University of Birmingham researcher Miranda Pallan says it shows \u201cschools can\u2019t do it alone\u201d and government measures are needed. &gt; Livestock raised for food in the US are dosed with five times as much antibiotic medicine as farm animals in the UK, new data has shown.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Hot tubs and cold rivers, Northern Ireland For our first night out together in over six months since having a baby we travelled to Galgorm resort and spa, near Ballymena. My husband pulled out all the stops and reserved a riverside hot tub. Hopping from the hot tub to refill my glass he lost his balance and tumbled backwards into the river Maine. I had a beautifully uninterrupted night\u2019s sleep in a giant comfy bed, while he lay flat on the floor nursing a bruised coccyx. RM Kelly The man in the mask, Venice A furious row with my boyfriend on Valentine\u2019s Day in St Mark\u2019s Square led to me storming off and getting caught up in a masked carnival parade in the streets, part of the Mardi Gras. We were also in costume and thought I saw my boyfriend so, regretting my actions, I shouted \u201csorry\u201d and kissed him. He kissed me back, passionately, silently, and we got caught up in the moment for a while. Then we ran alongside a canal holding hands and embraced again. He drew breath to tell me I was \u201cfantastica, bellissima, stupenda\u201d, before revealing his face as a handsome Italian young man. funinfinland Carnival capers in Madeira I love Madeira\u2019s festivals and applied to participate in Funchal\u2019s Mardi Gras carnival, which coincided with Dia dos Namorados (Valentine\u2019s Day). Sparkly costume fitted, I attended rehearsals, eventually mastering a passable salsa. The day dawned. Shimmying through the main square as part of a throng of exuberant dancers, I felt a sharp tug at my rear. Someone had accidentally trodden on my flowing \u201cunicorn tail\u201d, pulling it, together with my sequined skirt, right off. From the watching crowd, a gallant man proffered his jacket to cover my embarrassment \u2026 That gent and I return annually to Funchal to celebrate a \u201ctale\u201d with a happy-ever-after ending. Moiraash Forest of Dean (and din), Gloucestershire For my first Valentine\u2019s with my boyfriend, I booked what I thought would be a romantic weekend break in the Forest of Dean. The first day we went out for a peaceful stroll through the woods hoping to see some woodland wildlife and hear the tranquil sounds of singing birds. We were abruptly met by the dreadful din of dozens of revving cars racing through the forest. There was an off-road rally going on all weekend. giddyk Surrey Hills passion killer For a getaway, my mother-in-law booked me and my husband a stay in a beautiful rustic cottage in the Surrey Hills. What she didn\u2019t realise was that the beautiful spot was a youth hostel and that she had booked us into dormitories. Luckily, peaceful walks and evenings spent drinking wine by the cosy log fire of YHA Tanners Hatch was just what we needed, even if retiring to our male and female dormitories at the end of the night hampered our more romantic aspirations. kin101 Lake District sartorial error We planned a romantic spa/hiking break in the Lakes including a meal at a top-class restaurant. We arrived at the airport only to be told we were late and had missed the bag drop so we could only take one piece of hand luggage each. We had packed a huge suitcase full of hiking gear. It seemed impossible to cram all of that into our two small rucksacks so we ended up throwing on as many clothes as we could and ran through the airport in our hiking boots just in time to make the final call. Once we finally arrived at our beautiful hotel in Windermere, we had a very quick turn around to be ready for our dinner at the much lauded Porto. I pulled my crumpled dress from the rucksack as Joe fumbled through his, checking, checking and checking again for his evening clothes. He\u2019d left them in the suitcase back at the airport. We arrived at the beautifully romantic restaurant, fresh roses on the table and candles lit, surrounded by immaculate couples and then there was my boyfriend, dressed top to toe as if he were about to hike 10 miles and attracting funny looks.

      "bodyText": "Childhood obesity programmes in schools are not the answer to the epidemic affecting the UK, according to researchers who say much wider local and national action is needed, including curbs on the advertising of junk food. A major obesity programme introduced into more than 50 primary schools in the West Midlands has failed to have any significant effect on children\u2019s weight. Children were given a year of extra physical activity sessions, a healthy eating programme and cookery workshops with their parents. Families were invited to activity events, including sessions run by Aston Villa football club. But at the end of 30 months, there was no difference in obesity between those children who took part and those who did not. The government\u2019s childhood obesity plan, launched from Downing Street in January last year, placed great emphasis on increasing sport and other activity in schools. A number of school-based obesity programmes have been introduced around the country, focusing on increasing physical activity and improving children\u2019s diet in school. But, says the team from the University of Birmingham\u2019s Institute of Applied Health Research, the negative results from their large study published in the British Medical Journal are in line with what has been found elsewhere; schools may have a role to play but can only be part of the answer to the obesity problem. \u201cWe need to look at ways that we can really engage communities in this agenda, change our local environment and look at how national policies can support diet and physical activity,\u201d said Miranda Pallan, one of the team.

We have committed $53m to implement a whole-of-government research and evaluation strategy for policies and programs affecting Indigenous Australians, including the IAS.</p> <p>Key recommendations for the commonwealth relate to the need for improved national leadership and coordination around early intervention and preventing children from entering the youth justice and child protection systems. This will include:</p> <p>\u00b7 Improving community engagement and partnerships</p> <p>\u00b7 Reviewing the approach to funding and evaluation including an audit of all funding going into the Northern Territory</p> <p>\u00b7 Taking a place-based approach to change</p> <p>\u00b7 Improving data collection and data sharing</p> <p>The commonwealth is committed to improving partnership arrangements with the Northern Territory government to ensure investments achieve improved outcomes for children, and make the community a safer place for everyone.</p> <p>The commonwealth has written to jurisdictions offering to fund the Custody Notification Scheme, including the Northern Territory, and we strongly encourage them to accept our offer.</p> <p>The commonwealth has sole or joint responsibility for 28 of the commission\u2019s 226 recommendations and minister for social services Dan Tehan will lead the commonwealth government\u2019s response.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commonwealth response can be found <a href=\"https://www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/news/2018/australian-government-response-to-the-royal-commission-into-the-protection-and-detention-of-children-in-the-northern-territory\">here</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T05:51:54.310Z\">at 5.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7be006e4b0365be5167ce6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T05:31:31.002Z\">5.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cDeeply disappointed, not just to me, but I bet to everyone of your listeners and people in uniform in Australia,\u201d is how <strong>Jim Molan</strong> describes the apology, when asked to sum up his feelings.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7bdea6e4b0365be5167cd0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T05:28:14.323Z\">5.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jim Molan </strong>is speaking to 2GB.</p> <p>On <strong>Adam Bandt\u2019</strong>s apology, he says he thinks it is \u201cflimsy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was deeply disappointed in the apology.\u201d</p> <p>Molan, who had previously hinted he may sue, says he wants Bandt to \u201creconsider it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I consider all my options to still be on the table and I am not accepting it.\u201d</p> <p>Bandt picked up <strong>Richard Di Natale\u2019s</strong> comments in the Senate about Molan\u2019s actions during the Iraq war, essentially intimating he was a war criminal.</p> <p>\u201cIf it had have been a contrite apology, I would have accepted it, but I don\u2019t see the contrition.\u201d <br></p> <p>He says Bandt apologised to him in person \u201cabout an hour and a half ago\u201d and he believed there was a lot more contrition there, but said he \u201cdidn\u2019t say I accepted it, I thanked him for the apology\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T05:30:17.195Z\">at 5.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7bdb8fe4b07556c9fb7b36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T05:14:04.184Z\">5.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the lower house the shadow attorney general, <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong>, has fiercely criticised the foreign influence register because of its impact on charities.</p> <p>The bill creates a new requirement for entities that seek to influence public policy on behalf of foreign principals to disclose this on a public register but has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/23/fear-rushed-foreign-influence-bill-will-harm-freedom-of-speech\">subject to a wide backlash due to fears even benign contributions to public debate will be captured</a>.</p> <p>Dreyfus:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Our commitment is to bipartisanship on national security matters but that does not extend to giving the government a blank cheque on what it wants ...</em></p> <p><em>What this bill does is increase red tape for the charities sector.

Well, I\u2019m 70 and I\u2019ve been hearing these stories from a long way back. The patience that the Indigenous people have represented just befuddles me. I\u2019m absolutely frustrated with the lack of change, the lack of achievement, the lack of listening, to what Indigenous people have been saying. They want a piece of the action. They want to be part of this deal. </p> <p><strong>Michael Long</strong> walked here many years ago and asked to be part of the solution. How long does it take for that to translate into policy, into practice, into delivering the kind of outcomes that we all want to see \u2013 which is equality of life for Indigenous peoples.<br></p> <p>We can\u2019t sit complacently around and listen to platitudes. We saw the prime minister walk out 15 minutes before the whole show was over. He may have had something important to do but he should have stayed there and listened. His staff surely knew what the time allocations were. It\u2019s indicative of the deafness, of the absolute derision and the contempt which this government is meting out to the Aboriginal people. So we\u2019ve got to get real about it.<br></p> <p>The minister for Aboriginal affairs is telling people who are concerned about the housing, the remote housing schemes, that they\u2019re not going to get any money after June. If you don\u2019t have housing, and if you don\u2019t fix up the housing needs of Indigenous peoples, it\u2019s one of the major contributors towards a better life for Indigenous peoples.<br></p> <p> There\u2019s so much anomaly, and so much sophistry going on in this government, that really we\u2019ve got to get beyond it. And that\u2019s what the message was: Talk plainly \u2013 the young woman at the end \u2013 sit down and have a yarn with us. Talk to us clearly, plainly, and we can help you find the solutions if you work with us. </p> <p>If that doesn\u2019t transpire into change by this government, then we seriously have a problem, not only nationally but internationally as a reputation for a fair go.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>(Yes, the prime minister did leave before the meeting ended, but as Calla pointed out, organisers were aware of his scheduled departure time.) </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T02:05:43.486Z\">at 2.05am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7ba6fae4b05abd28aab6d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T01:28:57.111Z\">1.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Amongst all of the craziness of the day, I forgot to point you to this story by<strong> Adam Gartrell</strong> at Fairfax: it looks like the antiretroviral drug PrEP is about to be approved for <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/hiv-has-nowhere-to-go-now-breakthrough-drug-prep-to-be-approved-for-public-subsidy-20180207-p4yzkt.html\">inclusion on the PBS</a>.

The brave souls who reached back into the darkness of their memories and brought their suffering to light.</p> <p> Not for their own sake but because they never want another generation to ever suffer what they did, to be disbelieved the way they were, to live with the pain they had to.</p> <p> I also think they did it for all of the other kids who didn\u2019t make it.</p> <p> I want to pay tribute to <strong>Julia Gillard</strong> for her leadership in establishing this royal commission \u2013 I actually think that with every passing day, that decision enhances her legacy.</p> <p> I do thank the royal commission and its staff, as the prime minister has done \u2013 remarkable, their work.</p> <p> Even though she is not going to ask me to do this, I also think the house should also recognise the work of the member for Jaga Jaga, Jenny Macklin, who has supported this endeavour with 100% of her passion for social justice.</p> <p> I had the privilege of standing alongside Jenny and a group of the remarkable campaigners from CLAN when the commission\u2019s final day of hearings were handed down, and then the report.</p> <p> They are extraordinary Australians \u2013 and I know many members of parliament on both sides of the house have spoken to them and know them, so they will know what I am saying. These are survivors, they have spent five years travelling to royal commission hearings around the country, to provide support to others as they tell their stories.</p> <p> I pay tribute to each and every one of them.</p> <p> Again, although she would modesty share credit with all others, I think it is appropriate that I note and salute the incomparable Leonie Sheedy: fierce, fearless, a heart as big as this continent. Australia owes her and all that she represents a huge debt.</p> <p> I have to say about the royal commission, the commissioners and their team \u2013 at all times they have balanced their human compassion for those providing testimony with the legal detachment to recommend a constructive way forward. </p> <p> But as the prime minister has said and every member of this place would agree: the hardest task, the most important work and the greatest credit belong to the survivors themselves.</p> <p> So, as the prime minister has done, I say to the survivors: Australia believes you \u2013 and Australia thanks you.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T00:30:25.430Z\">at 12.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b943be4b07556c9fb79fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-08T00:09:18.122Z\">12.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u201cPeople\u2019s privates lives are their private lives, but I do make the comment, not staff fellas,\u201d Bob Katter said.</p> <p>\u201c...

If the UK government has put that in writing, it is a bit much for the Australian government to say they are absolutely certain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201c...We had said it was deeply personal circumstances, we had asked the government to not keep pushing, and they did. They now know. And that should close the legal argument. I only raise Josh\u2019s situation, with respect to say, if the government says \u2018oh, well it\u2019s all black letter law and that is how we have to look at it\u2019, I simply put to them that when they came to us, that his circumstance should be treated differently, we did.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a7b6f1be4b07556c9fb7926\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-07T21:48:44.909Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning and welcome to day 4</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well, this week has been a long year, but we made it, politics livers!</p> <p>Almost.</p> <p>You may have noticed there hasn\u2019t been a lot of policy this week. You wouldn\u2019t be the only one. After declaring 2018 was its year, the government has struggled to get its agenda up front and centre.</p> <p>That could have something to do with its newest senator refusing to back down for sharing racist, largely debunked materials on social media, the deputy prime minister\u2019s baby news, and section 44 continuing to cast its loooong shadow over the parliament.<br></p> <p>But there has been some movement at the station. After Labor indicated it could not support the government\u2019s national security laws if they saw journalists prosecuted (among other things), Attorney-General <strong>Christian Porter </strong>has said he\u2019ll take another look.</p> <p>As <strong>Paul Karp</strong> reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jan/25/coalitions-security-laws-criminalise-reporting-media-companies-warn\">contains prison sentences of up to 20 years</a> for dealing with or publishing protected information such as material that is harmful or likely to harm Australia\u2019s interests, subject to very limited exemptions for public interest journalism</p> <p>Under changes revealed late on Wednesday by attorney general, Christian Porter, people not employed by the Commonwealth, including journalists, will only be liable in serious circumstances where they willingly communicate \u201csecret\u201d information that endangers the health and safety of the public, or prejudices national security.</p> </blockquote> <p>But politics continues to dominate. <strong>Susan Lamb </strong>may have delivered her statement explaining her situation yesterday, but the government said it will still consider forcing the Longman MP\u2019s referral to the high court.</p> <p>Speaking of the high court, it ruled that Tasmanian mayor <strong>Steve Martin </strong>is eligible to take up <strong>Jacqui Lambie\u2019s</strong> seat in the senate.

      "bodyText": "We made it, folks. That\u2019s the first week done and dusted. At least as far as parliament is concerned. Until next week. Tomorrow, the state and territory leaders will descend en masse on Canberra for Coag, which means it is also time for the world\u2019s most awkward joint press conference. Katharine Murphy and I will be bringing you those highlights tomorrow. Along with hospital funding, Closing the Gap, national security, protecting children \u2013 including the cyber bullying discussion and early childhood education, are all on the agenda. Mike Bowers will be back with us next week, but do check out his Instagram and Twitter for some of the day\u2019s events. You can find me at @amyremeikis and @ifyouseeamy (if video updates of politics are your thing. Full disclosure, there is also some whinging). A very big thank you to the Guardian Australia brains trust for dragging me through this week. It was a close one. And before I leave what my father affectionally refers to as \u201cbullshit castle\u201d for the day, a very big thank you to the readers, for playing along this week. We will be back just after 8am on Monday with the next instalment of Politics Live. In the mean time, have a lovely weekend and take care. The government has responded to the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory: The commonwealth government will focus on improved national leadership and the coordination of early intervention for at-risk children in its response to the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory. The government has carefully considered the report and responded in a timely manner. While the majority of the findings and recommendations are matters for the Northern Territory government, which has responsibility for child protection and youth justice systems, there are a number of recommendations that solely or partially relate to the commonwealth and we are committed to taking action where appropriate. The commonwealth invests $790 million of the Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS) into the Northern Territory, including one third of the Community and Safety Programme funding under the IAS. The commission found the issue is not a lack of funding, rather, it is the lack of coordination and understanding of how that money is spent and what outcomes are being achieved. The commonwealth is committed to working more closely with the Northern Territory government, leaders and Aboriginal communities to better prioritise and coordinate a place-based approach. We have committed $53m to implement a whole-of-government research and evaluation strategy for policies and programs affecting Indigenous Australians, including the IAS. Key recommendations for the commonwealth relate to the need for improved national leadership and coordination around early intervention and preventing children from entering the youth justice and child protection systems. This will include: \u00b7 Improving community engagement and partnerships \u00b7 Reviewing the approach to funding and evaluation including an audit of all funding going into the Northern Territory \u00b7 Taking a place-based approach to change \u00b7 Improving data collection and data sharing The commonwealth is committed to improving partnership arrangements with the Northern Territory government to ensure investments achieve improved outcomes for children, and make the community a safer place for everyone. The commonwealth has written to jurisdictions offering to fund the Custody Notification Scheme, including the Northern Territory, and we strongly encourage them to accept our offer. The commonwealth has sole or joint responsibility for 28 of the commission\u2019s 226 recommendations and minister for social services Dan Tehan will lead the commonwealth government\u2019s response. The commonwealth response can be found here \u201cDeeply disappointed, not just to me, but I bet to everyone of your listeners and people in uniform in Australia,\u201d is how Jim Molan describes the apology, when asked to sum up his feelings. Jim Molan is speaking to 2GB. On Adam Bandt\u2019s apology, he says he thinks it is \u201cflimsy\u201d. \u201cI was deeply disappointed in the apology.\u201d Molan, who had previously hinted he may sue, says he wants Bandt to \u201creconsider it\u201d. \u201cAnd I consider all my options to still be on the table and I am not accepting it.\u201d Bandt picked up Richard Di Natale\u2019s comments in the Senate about Molan\u2019s actions during the Iraq war, essentially intimating he was a war criminal. \u201cIf it had have been a contrite apology, I would have accepted it, but I don\u2019t see the contrition.\u201d He says Bandt apologised to him in person \u201cabout an hour and a half ago\u201d and he believed there was a lot more contrition there, but said he \u201cdidn\u2019t say I accepted it, I thanked him for the apology\u201d. In the lower house the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has fiercely criticised the foreign influence register because of its impact on charities. The bill creates a new requirement for entities that seek to influence public policy on behalf of foreign principals to disclose this on a public register but has been subject to a wide backlash due to fears even benign contributions to public debate will be captured. Dreyfus: Our commitment is to bipartisanship on national security matters but that does not extend to giving the government a blank cheque on what it wants ... What this bill does is increase red tape for the charities sector. The effect of extraordinarily expansive definitions in the scheme means the bill will capture Australian charities whose conduct and activities are entirely benign and completely of benefit to our nation. This will be imposed despite the fact these charities are all already closely regulated by Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. Dreyfus said he hoped this was merely a case of \u201csloppy drafting\u201d but warned the government if this was intentional it was \u201ctruly shameful\u201d. He said: We in the Labor party think that giving in to an assault on civil society is an abdication of our responsibility to protect and nurture the crucial role Australian civil society has in creating a fair and equal nation. The first speech on the matter of public importance was from Labor\u2019s charities spokesman, Andrew Leigh, who spoke against the increase in red tape for charities in the Electoral Funding and Disclosure bill. \u201cBanning donations to political parties should not include curtailing free speech,\u201d he said, warning the bill conflates political campaigning by parties and issues advocacy by charities. He warned religious charities have said under the proposed changes the collection plate could not be handed around in church without a warning that foreigners cannot donate. An interjection I missed! As Paul Fletcher got up to not answer a question about whether the rail line to the new western Sydney airport will open at the same time as the airport itself, Ed Husic managed to slip in \u201cFletch, don\u2019t kill my vibe\u201d. And if you don\u2019t get the reference, well, I\u2019m sorry to say, you may be too old. It\u2019s what all the kids are listening to these days. Meanwhile: Statement from Adam Bandt Yesterday I made statements about Senator Jim Molan on Sky TV. Mr Molan has stated: \u201cI would invite Mr Bandt to offer me a public apology\u2026If he publicly apologised to me for the statements that he made, then that would end the problem.\u201d I hereby apologise for those statements. *end statement* A little more Mike Bowers magic for you Question time ends. Labor groans. Because apparently there is no such thing as too much punishment. We just had a question for Craig Laundy on small business from Brendan O\u2019Connor, but my computer had a slight meltdown and I missed it in the reboot. I don\u2019t think any of us missed anything too much. Or something we haven\u2019t heard before. Because question time this week may as well be repetition time. Josh Frydenberg is next on the #deathtodixers train. I did miss telling you about an entertaining interaction a few minutes ago; after Dan Tehan finished his dixer, Jenny Macklin asked for him to table the document he read from \u201cword for word\u201d. It was not tabled. Confidentiality, you understand. Labor gets in its question aimed at the Tasmanian election, with Justine Keay asking about hospital funding cuts, resulting in a \u201c60 per cent increase to 72 days\u201d for public hospital waiting times. Greg Hunt gets in the Coalition\u2019s Tasmanian election answer, blaming previous Labor governments. Christian Porter is next with a dixer, but the chamber listens in absolute silence, as it is about the national redress scheme for survivors of institutional sexual assault. He calls on the institutions, and states and other involved entities, to stop with the excuses and stop the delays. Both the government and opposition side of the chamber give it a \u201chear hear\u201d. Bill Shorten says the opposition agrees with the \u201cno more excuses\u201d stance and will do what it can to assist the government on this matter. From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: Dan Tehan gets the next dixer. Feel free to start delving into your own existential crises. You\u2019ve got a few minutes. I feel safer already after that monologue. The member for Werriwa, Anne Stanley, has a question about the rail line for western Sydney airport for Paul Fletcher (\u201cOh, no,\u201d yells the Labor backbench) and whether it would be open when the airport was open. Fletcher starts talking about how it took the Coalition to deliver the airport, and then continues to talk about the \u201cconnectivity\u201d to the airport. Labor starts yelling that it is about a train and \u201cchoo, choo\u201d calls begin coming from the opposition benches. #theministerdoesnotanswerthequestion Katharine Murphy has a Coag development (the meeting is being held in Canberra tomorrow). The Turnbull government has offered the states a percentage of a $100m health \u201cinnovation\u201d fund if they sign up to a new funding deal at Friday\u2019s meeting of the Council of Australian Governments. An extract of the draft heads of agreement circulating before Friday\u2019s meeting obtained by Guardian Australia says 50% of the proposed $100m fund \u201cwill be made available for the use of states that sign up to this agreement on 9 February 2018, to be divided amongst signatory states\u201d. You can read more about that here Jenny Macklin asks Dan Tehan what the government is doing to lower rates for pensioners. Tehan says the government will \u201cconsider all options that will help Australians get a job\u201d. His wider point is lost to the many, many interjections from both sides of the chamber. He shouts to be heard, but runs out of time. The chamber moves on to it\u2019s daily dose of Dutton dixer. Another question on tax cuts from Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull on whether or not the Coalition will take the tax cuts to the next election. Turnbull says he hopes to get them passed \u201cin this parliament\u201d. \u201cAnd yes, we will go to the next election with the benefit of those tax cuts flowing through into thousands of new jobs,\u201d he said. But with Labor, the Greens, NXT and now One Nation against the company tax cut, I am not sure how they plan on getting it through the Senate. #deathtodixers Sharon Bird, the member for Cunningham asks: Every member of the government, including the member for Gilmore, voted five times to give big business a $65bn handout today. If the government had its way, a single-income family living in Nowra, earning [under $60,000] will pay an extra $300 in tax every year. Why is the prime minister hurting families and my community to pay for his $65bn handout to big business? Malcolm Turnbull gives the NDIS answer, that being that increasing the Medicare levy was because Labor did not have a way to fund the national disability scheme (Tveeder has carked it again, so sorry for the summary) #deathtodixers Chris Bowen has a question on the business tax cuts. I missed the beginning, but it was about the Coalition voting for it this morning, while wage growth is stagnant. Malcolm Turnbull gives the same answer you have heard all week. Seriously, I could just copy and paste from any other day this week and it would be faster. Maybe we could just copy and paste one of the question times from earlier and all go to the pub. I doubt anyone would notice anything different. And we would all be a lot happier. It\u2019s an \u201caware of any alternative approaches\u201d dixer, which may be the worst dixer of all. I have a suggestion for an alternative approach (and it\u2019s bipartisan. I hated them when the Queensland Labor government did them as well, in my former life as a #qldpol reporter) ask actual questions for your constituents, instead of something which has been written by a ministerial staffer, for a performance no one is going to see outside this place. Bill Shorten to Malcolm Turnbull: Despite company profits increasing by 20% last year, but average wages for Australians only growing by 2%, every member of this government voted five times to give big business a $65bn corporate tax cut. Why does every member of the government only ever look after the big end of town and ignore ordinary workers struggling with record low wages growth? Do you really need this answer? Because we have heard it, every day this week. Multiple times. Well, it\u2019s not exactly an answer, but a list of Labor\u2019s sins. Turnbull: We need to encourage the private sector, the private sector that the leader of the opposition in his latest incarnation as a political populist whatever \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn he\u2019s impersonating at the moment \u2013 he now wants to declare a war on business. Well, I will remind the leader of the opposition that there was a time when he knew that cutting tax on businesses created more jobs. He said so and he and all of his side of politics voted for it again and again. Because it was commonsense and orthodox economics. But let\u2019s look at what he\u2019s opposing. He opposes \u2013 he opposed the tax cuts for small and medium family businesses that are now creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. He voted against them. He opposed the legislation that funds every school according to need. For the first time national consistent needs-based funding as recommended by David Gonski. Voted against that. He voted against the childcare reform ... \u201d And so on, and so on. I\u2019m too tired for this today. Barnaby Joyce gets the next dixer. And it\u2019s the first time he has attacked Labor all week in the answer. He picks up on Emma Husar\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d taunt to Scott Morrison and throws it back. He\u2019s still not back to full-force yet though. Bob Katter has the crossbench question. He says it is the \u201cfirst time I am in danger of being boring\u201d. To the prime minister: National partnerships on remote housing is already terminating now. Queensland over the 10 years gave $660m, and Canberra gave the 11 million. The LGAQ says 400 jobs and present apprenticeships and 1,500 new houses. Occupancy rates are still around 15 people per house. Rudd-Abbott\u2019s legacy was 1,500 homes. What do you want to be yours, prime minister?\u201d Turnbull: I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course,the subject matter is it the same as that asked by the member for Herbert, so I would refer the honourable member to the minister\u2019s answer, and just confirm that we are negotiating a new agreement for remote housing with the jurisdictions who remain part of the terminating program. It is very important, as the honourable member knows, as a former minister in Queensland, this is a core state housing \u2013 state housing is a core-state responsibility. It is very important that in any new arrangements the states step up to their responsibility. Cathy O\u2019Toole, the member for Herbert, asks Malcolm Turnbull: Will the prime minister today commit to renewing in full the national partnership on remote housing which expires in June this year? Or is the prime minister preparing to give up on this critical part of Closing the Gap framework? Ken Wyatt fronts up to the despatch box: The negotiations that we will continue to have with state and territory governments that are important in this are important because Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are citizens of each state and territory jurisdiction and must be accorded the same consideration as it would the general population in terms of the housing bilateral agreements that exist between the commonwealth and the state and territory jurisdiction. They have to be considered in that context because what we tend to do is that we set up separate programs that become the feature and focus of access to infrastructure and housing. This takes this beyond this. This is about Indigenous leaders having raised the issue of the contribution of both commonwealth and state and territories to their living standards to their way of life, but to the equality they seek in every aspect of what they hope to be their journey within our country. John Alexander gets to ask a dixer and Scott Morrison is VERY excited. He upgrades his delivery to little-Timmy-is-about-score-the-under-10s-final-winning-try as he talks about Labor losing its \u201ceconomic compass\u201d. \u201cBoring,\u201d someone from Labor yells. \u201cBORING? IT\u2019s BORING?\u201d Morrison yells back. The chamber erupts into one giant boring cacophony, but at least they look alive. Barnaby Joyce is still reading. Bob Katter has made it to question time. You are up to date. Linda Burney asks if the government will rule out on giving up any of the seven existing Closing the Gap targets and \u201cwhy is the government making it harder to achieve Closing the Gap targets, including the target to close the gap in life expectancy within a generation by cutting half a billion dollars from the Indigenous affairs budget?\u201d Malcolm Turnbull says he wants Ken Wyatt to add to the answer, but starts with: The proposition that the government is cutting funding for \u2013 for Indigenous affairs is simply wrong. We are putting ... more resources into Indigenous advancement all the time, and I want to just remind honourable members of the \u2013 what I said a moment ago in my earlier answer, of the signal success of the Indigenous procurement policy. We all understand that economic empowerment is fundamental and the commonwealth has shown strong leadership there in that regard and it has been a success beyond all expectations. We\u2019re getting buy-in from state and territory governments and from the corporate sector.\u201d Wyatt then takes over: The priorities that have remained as the targets for Closing the Gap have been consistent. What we have is a 200-year level of disparity and in 10 years we have set targets that address health, education, and we\u2019re extending that to employment opportunities and the way in which we bring forward some of the levels of disparity in a way that we\u2019ve not been able to achieve to the extent that we had under the 10-year bilateral agreement between \u2013 both sides of this chamber, that the level of commitment to making a difference doesn\u2019t diminish. Certainly, within the health sector, we\u2019ve had some significant gains made and we will continue to look at how we access mainstream resources that are available to all Australians and that will include the use of PBS items, PBS, to make sure that journey \u2013 just in health alone \u2013 incorporates other opportunities, but that doesn\u2019t diminish from the existing effort, nor the commitment to funding, and we will continue to focus on making sure that we close the gap in every facet of lives for Indigenous Australians.\u201d The transcription service I use to get these questions and answers to you is having a very, very bad day. So, today, I am going to have to deliver you the vibe and gist of the questions and answers, I\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s not enough time in between to transcribe. Bill Shorten is up first and he asks Malcolm Turnbull about Closing the Gap and the report which found it had been effectively abandoned. Turnbull talks through what the government has been doing and ends with saying the government is doing things for and with Indigenous communities, not \u201cto them\u201d. We move on to a dixer and my brain becomes a test pattern. Expect Closing the Gap to be a big issue today It\u2019s that time of day again (thankfully for the last time this week, because honestly, we all need a break). I\u2019m heading into the chamber so I can try and catch some of those heckles and interruptions during question time you all love so much. Scott Morrison delivered a speech on the government\u2019s company tax cut legislation, which passed the House of Reps this morning: This is the day when in this place they [Labor] will vote their economic credentials out of existence. This is why they cannot be trusted to manage our $1.8 trillion economy \u2014 because they have lost their economic compass. They don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. They don\u2019t know how to drive growth in the economy. They have no plan to lift wages in this country. They have embarked on their voyage to the other side to cohabit with the Greens, who now write economic policy for the Labor party. As I said the other day in this place, when it comes to economic policy, if you don\u2019t know what you believe, no one will believe in you, and that\u2019s why no one believes in the Labor party\u2019s economic credentials anymore.\u201d Just a reminder, the tax cuts are going to sit in the Senate and not move, with Labor, the Greens and NXT against the legislation. Have we found the MP Bob Katter was talking about? AAP has reported Peter Dutton was on 2GB this morning and things got emotional: Peter Dutton has choked back tears during a live radio interview after the father of a one-punch victim called to thank him for deporting a man involved in the Queensland killing. Steve Miller, whose son Cole was killed in a January 2016 attack, praised the home affairs minister for acting swiftly to deport New Zealander Daniel Maxwell after he was handed an 18-month suspended sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional thing, it really is,\u201d Mr Dutton said, after hearing from Mr Miller on 2GB radio on Thursday.\u201d Meanwhile, the Batman byelection campaign has begun in earnest Here is some of what Pat Dobson said this morning, after the Closing the Gap meeting. Mr [Rod] Little said today that he was 60, and he spoke about his family. Well, I\u2019m 70 and I\u2019ve been hearing these stories from a long way back. The patience that the Indigenous people have represented just befuddles me. I\u2019m absolutely frustrated with the lack of change, the lack of achievement, the lack of listening, to what Indigenous people have been saying. They want a piece of the action. They want to be part of this deal. Michael Long walked here many years ago and asked to be part of the solution. How long does it take for that to translate into policy, into practice, into delivering the kind of outcomes that we all want to see \u2013 which is equality of life for Indigenous peoples. We can\u2019t sit complacently around and listen to platitudes. We saw the prime minister walk out 15 minutes before the whole show was over. He may have had something important to do but he should have stayed there and listened. His staff surely knew what the time allocations were. It\u2019s indicative of the deafness, of the absolute derision and the contempt which this government is meting out to the Aboriginal people. So we\u2019ve got to get real about it. The minister for Aboriginal affairs is telling people who are concerned about the housing, the remote housing schemes, that they\u2019re not going to get any money after June. If you don\u2019t have housing, and if you don\u2019t fix up the housing needs of Indigenous peoples, it\u2019s one of the major contributors towards a better life for Indigenous peoples. There\u2019s so much anomaly, and so much sophistry going on in this government, that really we\u2019ve got to get beyond it. And that\u2019s what the message was: Talk plainly \u2013 the young woman at the end \u2013 sit down and have a yarn with us. Talk to us clearly, plainly, and we can help you find the solutions if you work with us. If that doesn\u2019t transpire into change by this government, then we seriously have a problem, not only nationally but internationally as a reputation for a fair go.\u201d (Yes, the prime minister did leave before the meeting ended, but as Calla pointed out, organisers were aware of his scheduled departure time.) Amongst all of the craziness of the day, I forgot to point you to this story by Adam Gartrell at Fairfax: it looks like the antiretroviral drug PrEP is about to be approved for inclusion on the PBS. That brings the cost of prescriptions down from thousands and thousands of dollars, to a couple of hundred a year. The Greens have lost a Senate disallowance motion to stop the cashless welfare card trials. Rachel Siewert: The evaluation has been done and the results do not justify further rollout, with many worrying negative trends \u2013 we need to put this awful social experiment to bed. \u201cI of course welcome the NXT and the ALP opposing in the House of Representatives the legislation to expand the card, but that they are happy for the current harmful trials to continue. Further, it is disappointing to see that there are amendments circulated by the Labor party to extend current trials into 2019. \u201cRather than drawing the trials out, we should be ending them.\u201d The Law Council of Australia has reacted to the news the government is prepared to water down its secrecy laws. From its statement: The Law Council of Australia today welcomed news that the federal government is moving to alter its proposed espionage and foreign interference laws in line with some of the concerns raised by the legal profession and others. According to reports, the government proposes to: \u00b7 Narrow definitions applying to commonwealth officers to \u2018conduct that would cause harm to Australia\u2019s interests\u2019, as well as the definitions of harmful information. \u00b7 Narrow the offence applied to non-commonwealth officers to only be applicable to \u2018the most serious and dangerous\u2019 conduct. \u00b7 Allow journalists to defend their reporting on the basis that they \u2018reasonably believe\u2019 it was in the public interest, and not a requirement to prove it was \u2018fair and accurate\u2019. Law Council of Australia president, Morry Bailes, said that while the legal peak body needed to review the government\u2019s proposed changes in detail, the reported shift was certainly in the right direction. \u201cThe Law Council\u2019s greatest concern is with the depth and breadth of the provisions and the unintended consequences that flow from them,\u201d Mr Bailes said. \u201cAlthough these amendments do not allay all of the Law Council\u2019s concerns, and more work is certainly needed, these initial amendments all appear to be positive. \u201cThe government\u2019s intention to narrow some of the critical definitions is particularly welcome and something that the Law Council has strongly recommended. \u201cWe also support attempts to narrow the scope of laws in relation to non-commonwealth officers. However, it is essential that there be an express \u2018harm\u2019 requirement inserted into the legislation, to absolutely ensure that the offences only apply to the most serious and dangerous conduct. \u201cWe still have a considerable way to go and we look forward to continuing to work closely with government, and parliament, to get these important measures right Julie Bishop was attending the Australia Awards Women\u2019s Leadership Initiative launch in parliament\u2019s Mural Hall, when the division bells rang. This was her reaction: Jacqui Lambie\u2019s Senate replacement, Steve Martin, is doing the rounds in Parliament House explaining why he will be an independent when he enters the Senate. On Wednesday evening Lambie made public a letter she had sent after the high court ruled he was eligible to replace her: Dear senator elect Martin, I congratulate you on your recent win in the high court. It sets a new legal precedent allowing local government representatives to run for federal office. The Jacqui Lambie Network prides itself on mateship, respect and integrity. I do not believe that your actions have been in keeping with these values, which I and the other [Jacqui Lambie Network] members hold dear. I don\u2019t feel you\u2019ve been honest or upfront with me since my resignation. Lambie accused Martin of reneging on a commitment to retain her staff and a \u201clack of commitment to the [JLN] since the last election shows us that you are not interested in following our values\u201d. At a doorstop, Martin said that after the high court decision Lambie tried to convince him to stand aside for her but he said he would enter the Senate as a JLN senator. \u201cI take it that as of last night at 8pm I am no longer with the JLN,\u201d he said, referring to the letter. Martin rejected Lambie\u2019s accusations \u2013 he noted that her staff\u2019s employment contracts were automatically terminated because of her resignation, and it wasn\u2019t his doing. Asked why he had not ruled out joining another party, he said: What I\u2019m doing is taking it step by step. I don\u2019t want to do a knee-jerk reaction or hypotheticals ... I\u2019m new at this, I\u2019ve got to come in on Monday morning with my lunch money tied in my hankie so I don\u2019t lose it. Martin said when he signed up to JLN he was promised a conscience vote on any issue. But asked about specific issues such as company tax cuts, he said, no, it\u2019s too early to comment on legislation. Martin is still the mayor of Devonport \u2013 he suggested he would step down in the six months prior to his term expiring in October to avoid a byelection. Caption this And I missed this, this morning, with everything else that was going on, but Mark Dreyfus spoke to Fran Kelly about Susan Lamb and the government\u2019s insistence on continuing to pursue her referral to the high court: This is about what happened before her nomination and she\u2019s provided a more than adequate explanation. You\u2019ve really got to ask what kind of people the Liberal government are that they are pursuing her and continuing with this in the face of that extraordinarily moving speech that she gave yesterday. What kind of people are they? It\u2019s clear that she took all reasonable steps, and that\u2019s so for the other two Labor MPs sitting in the House of Representatives who the government has said that they want to pursue unilaterally. It\u2019s time we moved on from this. The government knocked back our attempt to put this behind us last year by referring all those MPs that who anyone said there was doubt. They now want to play a party game, pursuing party advantage and I think any Australians that saw Susan Lamb\u2019s speech would see just how wrong it is for the government to continue this pursuit.\u201d Question time should be fun. Doug Cameron was out and about this morning and had this to say about Jim Molan: I see there has been more revelations about Senator Molan producing and sending out more discriminatory, basically racist and bigoted posts. I just think this guy has to apologise to the Australian parliament, I think he has to apologise to the Australian public. For Andrew Bolt of all people to argue \u2013 \u2018this is a guy who has been attacked wrongly\u2019 \u2013 Andrew Bolt should look at what this guy has done, the security people, Asio, have said that this is the wrong thing to do, that you should not be pushing out rubbish like this and for a senator to continue to deny that he has done this with any knowledge I think just beggars belief. It doesn\u2019t pass the pub test and he should just get out and apologise and if he doesn\u2019t then that weak-kneed prime minister Malcolm Turnbull should make him do it, if he has got the courage to do it.\u201d Senator Molan says he will not be apologising, as he does not believe he did anything wrong. He does regret not scrubbing his (since deleted) social media though. The Murray-Darling Basin plan issue is heating up. This has just lobbed from Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s office: Today\u2019s revelations that South Australia has been sold down the river about how much water it would lose [under] the government\u2019s change to the Murray Darling Basin Plan are further proof why the plan should not be scaled back, the Australian Greens say. Big irrigators and upstream states are always claiming that South Australia is too far downstream for anything to matter \u2013 that\u2019s just not true, the Greens\u2019 Murray Darling Basin spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, says. To say that South Australia would lose only 4 billion litres of water if the changes to the Murray Darling Basin Plan goes ahead, when it is actually more like 20 bn litres, is a disgrace and discredits the Murray Darling Basin Authority\u2019s recommendations. South Australia shouldn\u2019t be consigned to a death by a thousand cuts. The water that was promised for the river, the river should get \u2013 no excuses. While New South Wales threatens to walk away from the plan, more scandals of their government\u2019s dodgy dealings with favouring greedy corporate irrigators have come to light. Secretly changing the rules to give more water to irrigators is disgraceful behaviour from a state that has clearly written the book on ripping off our nation\u2019s biggest river system. The plan is not being adhered to and the river is dying. This has dire consequences for South Australia and I will not stand by and let it happen. Corruption and water theft are rife and communities in the basin are being screwed over. South Australia doesn\u2019t deserve to be left high and dry by a federal government complicit in peddling lies. I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Greens\u2019 disallowance and stand up for a healthy river system. Senator-in-waiting Steve Martin, who was expelled from Jacqui Lambie\u2019s party overnight, by Jacqui Lambie, after he was ruled eligible to take her spot in the Senate, told Sky Lambie had asked him to step aside so she could take back her seat, saying it was what \u201cthe Tasmanian people wanted\u201d. He did not. And here we are. Just on Bob Katter\u2019s little revelation someone in parliament wants to try and ban (sexual) relationships between staffers and their bosses, we have ruled out: Andrew Wilkie Adam Bandt Rebekha Sharkie Derryn Hinch (who told Paul Karp: No I don\u2019t [know who is proposing it]. Certainly not me. And you don\u2019t read anything into that\u201d Cory Bernardi Fraser Anning Some of what Bill Shorten told the house, following the prime minister\u2019s statement on institutional child abuse: The royal commission has stripped away the denial and betrayal of decades. Painfully at times, it has exposed the most unforgivable and unimaginable acts of evil. It has shown, without doubt or exception, the extraordinary courage of all the survivors who stepped forward to tell their story. The brave souls who reached back into the darkness of their memories and brought their suffering to light. Not for their own sake but because they never want another generation to ever suffer what they did, to be disbelieved the way they were, to live with the pain they had to. I also think they did it for all of the other kids who didn\u2019t make it. I want to pay tribute to Julia Gillard for her leadership in establishing this royal commission \u2013 I actually think that with every passing day, that decision enhances her legacy. I do thank the royal commission and its staff, as the prime minister has done \u2013 remarkable, their work. Even though she is not going to ask me to do this, I also think the house should also recognise the work of the member for Jaga Jaga, Jenny Macklin, who has supported this endeavour with 100% of her passion for social justice. I had the privilege of standing alongside Jenny and a group of the remarkable campaigners from CLAN when the commission\u2019s final day of hearings were handed down, and then the report. They are extraordinary Australians \u2013 and I know many members of parliament on both sides of the house have spoken to them and know them, so they will know what I am saying. These are survivors, they have spent five years travelling to royal commission hearings around the country, to provide support to others as they tell their stories. I pay tribute to each and every one of them. Again, although she would modesty share credit with all others, I think it is appropriate that I note and salute the incomparable Leonie Sheedy: fierce, fearless, a heart as big as this continent. Australia owes her and all that she represents a huge debt. I have to say about the royal commission, the commissioners and their team \u2013 at all times they have balanced their human compassion for those providing testimony with the legal detachment to recommend a constructive way forward. But as the prime minister has said and every member of this place would agree: the hardest task, the most important work and the greatest credit belong to the survivors themselves. So, as the prime minister has done, I say to the survivors: Australia believes you \u2013 and Australia thanks you. \u201cPeople\u2019s privates lives are their private lives, but I do make the comment, not staff fellas,\u201d Bob Katter said. \u201c... But love conquers all, I suppose, so I am not being critical.\u201d (Except of course, if it is a same-sex love. And then he is not only critical, but straight up offensive.) But here is what he said when asked about the US law banning romances between politicians and staffers: \u201cWe are going to know very shortly, because one of the crossbenchers said to me this morning they are going to move along similar lines.\u201d He won\u2019t say who it was. \u201cI didn\u2019t say senator, I just said crossbencher.\u201d As to whether he would support it: \u201cI would think about it. You are just in an enormously influential position with staff. And I just, fellas, please, I support the spirit of it, certainly.\u201d Bob Katter (he\u2019s here!) just told Sam Maiden on Sky a crossbencher is planning on introducing legislation which would ban relationships between staffers and MPs. A similar law has just passed in the States (United, not Australian). The government\u2019s company tax cut has just passed the lower house (dropping it from 30% to 25%) but that doesn\u2019t really mean anything. Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team are not budging in their opposition to the cuts. So this legislation will languish in the Senate for quite some time. Some of what Malcolm Turnbull said this morning in the parliament: They relived the worst moments of their lives, often telling their stories for the first time, so these terrible abuses would never be allowed to happen again. The report\u2019s 409 recommendations propose significant reforms to ensure the children in the care of any Australian institutions are protected. There is no more important obligation for every Australian adult than keeping our children from harm. Reading some of the witness statements, it is clear that being heard and being believed means so much to the survivors. So much. Much more than many of us would imagine. Three words \u2013 \u2018I believe you\u2019 \u2013 coming after years, decades, of authorities\u2019 denial of responsibility.\u201d A taskforce has been established within the Attorney General\u2019s Department to co-ordinate responses. The redress scheme will begin 1 July. A national apology will be delivered before the end of the year. In news which will clear some things up for his Queensland LNP colleagues, George Brandis has officially left the building. Effective immediately. The Closing the Gap breakfast, and the Closing the Gap statement, which happens in parliament a week later, are annual bipartisan events. Given the spirit of bipartisanship that usually surrounds Closing the Gap, Labor senators Pat Dodson and Malarndirri McCarthy, with Linda Burney and Bill Shorten standing by, say they should have been involved in the refresh process that has been happening since at least October. Speaking at a press conference following the breakfast this morning, McCarthy said: Bipartisanship is always what Close the Gap was all about. The one day of the parliamentary year where our country and all representatives in the parliament would focus on First Nations\u2019 issues in this country. In all of these dialogues that have taken place, no one from the Labor party, no one from the Greens or minor parties, has been involved. And it\u2019s an absolute disgrace that you have Indigenous members in this parliament who were not included, who were not invited, who have not been briefed on anything to do with Close the Gap.\u201d Six Indigenous delegates from each state and territory, and 19 nominated by the commonwealth, met in Canberra yesterday and today to talk through the refresh process and how the Closing the Gap strategy should be redesigned. Tomorrow it\u2019ll go to Coag, and I\u2019ve been told the expectation is that the outline of the new Closing the Gap strategy, if not the detail, will be set then. As Amy mentioned, Malcolm Turnbull left the breakfast just before 8.30am, after June Oscar had given her address about how the first 10 years had comprehensively failed. The organisers knew he would be leaving then. Dodson said that was a bad look. This is the leader of our country, and this is a major event, this is an international event. This will go overseas, and if anyone focused on the leader of this nation walking out on a major report by reputable Aboriginal leaders, they\u2019d have to think, well, we really do feel for the Indigenous people.\u201d Earlier today, Sir Michael was there as the Close the Gap Steering Committee held a function at parliament house. Malcolm Turnbull left early. Labor senator Pat Dodson called it \u201ca disgrace\u201d. We now know what the PM was leaving to do, but I can understand the anger. Especially after what happened with the Uluru statement. Mike Bowers was in the chamber when Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten delivered their statements on this. On this issue, the government and the opposition are in lockstep. As they should be. Malcolm Turnbull will deliver the apology to the victims of institutional sexual abuse in parliament before the end of the year. If any one has read any of the stories contained within the report, you\u2019ll know this is long overdue. It can\u2019t make it right, but as the prime minister said, hearing \u201cI believe you\u201d is extremely important to people who spent decades being ignored. It\u2019s only right the nation says it as one. The prime minister says the redress scheme for survivors will begin on 1 July \u2013 but he says the states and territories need to sign up. He said he will also be offering an official apology. Using a statement on indulgence, Malcolm Turnbull speaks about the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Just on that Close the Gap meeting \u2013 the prime minister left about 15 minutes early. Community leaders were still talking, but between talks, Malcolm Turnbull left. (He did speak to a few people before going). He is now making a statement in the house. We have just been given notice of this and the bells are still ringing. Bill Shorten has held a door stop following a Close the Gap committee meeting. Because this week is not done with me yet, my recorder failed. I\u2019ll chase down the actual comments for you as soon as I can, but he spoke about Susan Lamb (and said he believes she has answered all questions against her) and Adani (same position; doesn\u2019t appear to stack up environmentally or financially) Pat Dodson also had a bit to say about the government\u2019s indigenous policies. Yet another reason for me to track down that audio for you. And of course Barnaby Joyce was talked about. Tony Burke said he believed his private life was no one\u2019s business. \u201cIt is none of my business. I haven\u2019t read the article, journalists will make their own decisions about what they believe they should report. But from my perspective, I saw the headline, I knew it was none of my business and I haven\u2019t read it. I don\u2019t intend to. And I hope for all the people concerned, after the public focus moves on, they can get on with their lives.\u201d Tony Burke was out and about on Sky early this morning, talking about the Susan Lamb situation. The government has basically said it feels for her difficult family situation (her full statement was one of the key events on yesterday\u2019s blog, for any one who missed it), but will still push for her referral to the high court, as it\u2019s a legal issue, not an emotional issue. Which of course set off comparisons to Josh Frydenberg\u2019s family situation (his mother arrived in Australia as stateless, after the Nazi-aligned Hungarian government stripped the jewish community of their citizenship, but Hungary, seeking to make amends for the past, reinstated citizenship in recent years). Burke said Labor would not be seeking to pursue Frydenberg. But said the same standards should apply. \u201cThe UK government said, in writing, they couldn\u2019t determine she [Susan Lamb] was a UK citizen. If the UK government has put that in writing, it is a bit much for the Australian government to say they are absolutely certain,\u201d he said. \u201c...We had said it was deeply personal circumstances, we had asked the government to not keep pushing, and they did. They now know. And that should close the legal argument. I only raise Josh\u2019s situation, with respect to say, if the government says \u2018oh, well it\u2019s all black letter law and that is how we have to look at it\u2019, I simply put to them that when they came to us, that his circumstance should be treated differently, we did.\u201d Well, this week has been a long year, but we made it, politics livers! Almost. You may have noticed there hasn\u2019t been a lot of policy this week. You wouldn\u2019t be the only one. After declaring 2018 was its year, the government has struggled to get its agenda up front and centre. That could have something to do with its newest senator refusing to back down for sharing racist, largely debunked materials on social media, the deputy prime minister\u2019s baby news, and section 44 continuing to cast its loooong shadow over the parliament. But there has been some movement at the station. After Labor indicated it could not support the government\u2019s national security laws if they saw journalists prosecuted (among other things), Attorney-General Christian Porter has said he\u2019ll take another look. As Paul Karp reports: The bill contains prison sentences of up to 20 years for dealing with or publishing protected information such as material that is harmful or likely to harm Australia\u2019s interests, subject to very limited exemptions for public interest journalism Under changes revealed late on Wednesday by attorney general, Christian Porter, people not employed by the Commonwealth, including journalists, will only be liable in serious circumstances where they willingly communicate \u201csecret\u201d information that endangers the health and safety of the public, or prejudices national security. But politics continues to dominate. Susan Lamb may have delivered her statement explaining her situation yesterday, but the government said it will still consider forcing the Longman MP\u2019s referral to the high court. Speaking of the high court, it ruled that Tasmanian mayor Steve Martin is eligible to take up Jacqui Lambie\u2019s seat in the senate. Lambie has responded by announcing she will be expelling Martin from her party. And Barnaby Joyce went on ABC\u2019s 7.30 overnight and said the breakdown of his marriage to Natalie was one of the \u201cgreatest failures\u201d of his life. I failed, and I\u2019m obviously incredibly sorry about that, but I\u2019m also \u2013 like other people \u2013 incredibly hurt that private issues get dragged into the public arena.\u201d Up to date? Let\u2019s get Thursday underway. Mike Bowers is out and about - catch him on @mpbowers and @mikepbowers and I am at my desk, fingers at the ready. You can get me in the comments and @amyremeikis and @ifyouseeamy, where you\u2019ll get video updates throughout the day.",

      "bodyText": "UK insurer Aviva is the second-biggest investor in the Polish coal industry, the most polluting in Europe, according to a report that looks at insurance firms\u2019 involvement in the sector. Aviva is among a number of major European insurers that are backing the expansion of Poland\u2019s coal industry, undermining international efforts to battle climate change, according to research from Unfriend Coal, a global network of organisations including Greenpeace Switzerland, 350.org and the UK Tar Sands Network. Aviva has invested \u00a3372.7m in Polish coal, more than any other insurance company apart from the Dutch firm Nationale Nederlanden, the report found. Poland\u2019s coal industry is the second biggest in Europe, after Germany. Pollution from Polish coal is estimated to cause 5,830 premature deaths across Europe every year, Unfriend Coal said. The UN recently called for a stop to new coal power plants and an accelerated phase-out of existing ones. But Polish companies are planning to build power plants able to generate more than 10 gigawatts and open new mines holding more than 3.2bn tonnes of lignite, the dirtiest form of coal. Aviva\u2019s investments are held through its Polish pension fund, OFE Aviva BZ WBK. The fund increased its holdings in Polish coal companies by more than \u00a345m between 2016 and 2017. It has a 2.3% stake in the country\u2019s largest power company PGE, which operates two of Europe\u2019s most polluting coal plants at Be\u0142chat\u00f3w and Tur\u00f3w and plans to build new coal plants generating more than 5.2GW. Peter Bosshard, Unfriend Coal coordinator, said: \u201cUnlike all other insurers which are taking action on coal, Aviva decided to focus on engagement rather than on divestment, and have only divested from very few companies if engagement was completely unproductive.\u201d Aviva said it invested more than \u00a3525m in low-carbon projects such as renewable windfarms and solar energy last year. It added that it engaged with companies that derive more than 30% of revenue from coal to improve their business practices and will divest \u201cwhere we do not see sufficient movement to transition away from coal\u201d. \u201cIn Poland, local pension companies, including Aviva, manage customers\u2019 assets under a strict regulatory regime and are not able to influence the investment strategy for these. The investment guidelines focus on domestic equity where the energy industry is the second largest after the banking sector,\u201d it said. European insurers have invested more than \u00a31.15bn in Polish coal companies and have signed at least 21 contracts insuring coal plants since 2013, according to Unfriend Coal. Europe\u2019s biggest insurer, Allianz, is leading a consortium underwriting the biggest coal power plant under construction in Europe at Opole near Katowice, a PGE project, which is due to start operating next year.

The government also approved two open export licences between December 2016 and September 2017, according to the latest available information from the Department of International Trade (DIT). These open licences permit recurrent exports of a wide range of military and telecoms parts such as cables and software systems \u201csensitive to eavesdropping\u201d, but the DIT is not obliged to reveal what, if anything, is sold. Honduras, the second poorest and most unequal country in the Americas, has been plagued by a deadly mix of violence, impunity and corruption since a July 2009 coup ushered the National party into power, where it has remained despite allegations of state sponsored killings, electoral fraud and links to organised crime. The country has been shaken by a fresh wave of unrest since the election in November. Despite widespread allegations of fraud \u2013 and calls by international observers for a fresh vote \u2013 incumbent president Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was eventually declared the winner. Amid massive daily street demonstrations, Hern\u00e1ndez unleashed thousands of police, Swat teams, soldiers and military police to crack down on protesters. At least 40 people have been killed since the elections, and more than 2,000 detained, with many held under a controversial new terrorism law. High-profile activists say they have been harassed and intimidated by security forces. The 2008 British Export Control Act prohibits the sale of arms to countries where there is a clear risk that they will be used to repress their own people. Nevertheless, the government has sanctioned the sale of spyware to authoritarian states including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Turkey, Egypt and now Honduras, despite evidence of surveillance technology being used to target activists and opponents. \u201cBritish law is unambiguous \u2026 [Yet] the government sold Honduras monitoring and decrypting technology expressly designed to eavesdrop on its citizens, months before the state rounded up thousands of people in a well-orchestrated surveillance operation,\u201d said Lloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP and member of the Commons committee for arms export control. Russell-Moyle has tabled a written parliamentary question asking the government to name the company which sold the spy equipment, and how it deemed it safe to sanction the sale. The spyware industry is growing, worth at least \u00a360m to the UK since 2008. More than a dozen companies have been granted licences to sell powerful telecommunications technology since 2015 including a subsidiary of the defence giant BAE Systems, but the DIT is not required to publish details of sales. Some of the export licences cover devices known as IMSI-catchers, which can monitor large numbers of mobile phones over broad areas. In Honduras, the Opposition Alliance Against the Dictatorship has condemned what they believed to be illegal interception of emails and mobile phone data. WhatsApp messages sent by Manuel Zelaya \u2013 the Liberal party president ousted in the 2009 coup \u2013 were published on bogus online media outlets overseas and then shared on social networks. \u201cBefore, during and after the 2017 presidential campaign, leaders of Alliance and their teams were subject to state espionage,\u201d said spokesman Rodolfo Pastor. \u201cThe information published was often manipulated to create confusion, distrust or division within the opposition.\u201d The Campaign Against Arms Trade called for the licences to be revoked and an investigation to determine whether UK equipment has been used to repress civilians. \u201cThe British government has serious questions to answer. It is totally irresponsible to sell surveillance equipment to authoritarian regimes like the one in Honduras.\u201d said the group\u2019s spokesman, Andrew Smith. A DIT spokesman said it did not license exports which failed to meet strict criteria, \u201cincluding where we assess there is a clear risk that the goods may be used for internal repression\u201d.",

So how can the current president, who has already served three terms and wielded power in the Kremlin continuously since 1999, be assured of victory in advance?</p> <p>The answer is that Russia\u2019s is an election in name only. In truth it is a sham and a smokescreen, designed to confer democratic respectability on to a corrupt oligarchy. For Russians accustomed to unaccountable rule from on high, this is nothing new. More surprising is the supine acquiescence, bordering on complicity, of western democracies.</p> <p>Putin will win on 18 March because the system he created, politely known as \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d, removes all elements of surprise.

By contrast, his own public appearances receive fawning&#xa0;blanket coverage.</p> <p>There are no presidential debates, no unsanctioned opinion polls. Rival candidates do exist, but they resemble sparring partners whose task is to legitimise the process while helping the champ show off his best punches. They include Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a sort of ultra-nationalist Screaming Lord Sutch, and Pavel&#xa0;Grudinin, the Communist party\u2019s candidate, who runs a privatised company called Lenin State Farm.</p> <p>Ksenia Sobchak, a liberal, pro-gay rights former reality&#xa0;TV host, claims to offer an alternative to Putinism.

And so far, he seems to be succeeding.</p> <p>If this rigged election were being held in Iran or Zimbabwe or Venezuela, screams of tweeted outrage would issue daily from the White House. But Donald Trump is strangely silent. Why? Everybody knows he has a soft spot for the hard man in the Kremlin.

      "bodyText": "Russia will vote in presidential elections next month that Vladimir Putin is certain to win. Consider that statement for a moment. An election implies a contest. So how can the current president, who has already served three terms and wielded power in the Kremlin continuously since 1999, be assured of victory in advance? The answer is that Russia\u2019s is an election in name only. In truth it is a sham and a smokescreen, designed to confer democratic respectability on to a corrupt oligarchy. For Russians accustomed to unaccountable rule from on high, this is nothing new. More surprising is the supine acquiescence, bordering on complicity, of western democracies. Putin will win on 18 March because the system he created, politely known as \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d, removes all elements of surprise. His most credible challenger, Alexei Navalny (who in any case did not expect to win), has been banned from participation on specious legal grounds. Last month Navalny was arrested while urging an election boycott. Putin\u2019s control of Russia\u2019s television outlets and other media means political opponents are virtually invisible, unless they are in court on a charge. By contrast, his own public appearances receive fawning blanket coverage. There are no presidential debates, no unsanctioned opinion polls. Rival candidates do exist, but they resemble sparring partners whose task is to legitimise the process while helping the champ show off his best punches. They include Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a sort of ultra-nationalist Screaming Lord Sutch, and Pavel Grudinin, the Communist party\u2019s candidate, who runs a privatised company called Lenin State Farm. Ksenia Sobchak, a liberal, pro-gay rights former reality TV host, claims to offer an alternative to Putinism. But her wealthy establishment background has prompted the dismissive nickname \u201cRussia\u2019s Paris Hilton\u201d. When Sobchak recently visited Grozny, stronghold of the Chechen warlord and Putin ally Ramzan Kadyrov, police harassed her and gangs of men shouted that she resembled a horse. Political theatre aside, Putin, projecting strength and continuity, knows he will win by a landslide. The fix is in. No other result is imaginable \u2013 or allowable. His main concern, analysts say, is achieving a high turnout and a big victory margin, surpassing the 64% he gained six years ago. He also wants an ostensibly free and fair election to boost his international credibility \u2013 and no repeat of the 2012 street protests. In other words, Putin wants it both ways: a genuine electoral contest and a no-risk, hands-down victory. And so far, he seems to be succeeding. If this rigged election were being held in Iran or Zimbabwe or Venezuela, screams of tweeted outrage would issue daily from the White House. But Donald Trump is strangely silent. Why? Everybody knows he has a soft spot for the hard man in the Kremlin. There are numerous personal, business and political crossovers. Some are the subject of a federal investigation. But even by Trump\u2019s standards, the current administration\u2019s behaviour is contemptible. Rather than condemning Navalny\u2019s harsh treatment and Russia\u2019s yawning democratic deficit, Trump last week refused to activate additional sanctions against Putin and his oligarchs that had been agreed by Congress last year. He might just as well have donned a \u201cVote Vlad\u201d campaign badge. This latest sign of collusion came despite a recent Senate minority report that furiously decried the global threat posed by Putin\u2019s Russia, and Trump\u2019s \u201cnegligent\u201d response. \u201cFor years,\u201d the report said, \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s government has engaged in a relentless assault to undermine democracy and the rule of law in Europe and the US. Mr Putin\u2019s Kremlin employs an asymmetric arsenal that includes military invasions, cyber-attacks, disinformation, support for fringe political groups, and the weaponisation of energy resources, organised crime, and corruption.\u201d It added: \u201cIf the US fails to work with urgency to address this complex and growing threat, the regime ... will continue to develop and refine its arsenal to use on democracies around the world, including against US elections in 2018 ... Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a US president.\u201d Trump\u2019s blind eye is not unique. Theresa May lambasted Putin in November for meddling in other people\u2019s elections and referendums. But neither she nor Boris Johnson has raised public objections to Putin stealing his own election. This silence contrasts sharply with oft-stated British concerns about upholding democracy in Africa and elsewhere. Europe\u2019s leading lights, France and Germany, have not been any more outspoken, although the EU did jib at Navalny\u2019s exclusion. The ban \u201ccasts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia\u201d, it inoffensively declared. And perish the thought that western governments might launch the same covert cyber and disinformation operations to influence Russia\u2019s polls that Putin has used against theirs. There is certainly no sign of it. If they are trying, it isn\u2019t working. Why this shaming diffidence, even deference, towards Putin\u2019s regime? Western ineffectiveness in sticking up for democracy in Moscow is matched by serial weakness over illegal Russian actions in Ukraine, the Balkans and Syria, where war crimes are committed daily under Putin\u2019s imprimatur. Perhaps western leaders fear instability, and financial and energy supply disruption, should Putin fall. Maybe an enfeebled, divided west has given up on post-Soviet, post-cold war democracy. In Trump\u2019s case, maybe he admires the dictatorial strongman approach and wishes to emulate it. Apologists say we do not understand Russia and Putin.

      "body": "<p>The crowd wandering through Berlin\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/gemaeldegalerie/home.html\">Gem\u00e4ldegalerie</a> may look like any other bunch of gallery-goers keeping out of the snow on a Saturday afternoon. Seasoned culture vultures, however, would recognise that the lanky, shaven-headed man in an Adidas jacket is choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/wayne-mcgregor\">Wayne McGregor</a>; that the Irishman in an overcoat is novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/colm-toibin\">Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn</a>; and that the energetic, white-haired woman in glasses is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/08/joan-jonas-performance-artist-venice-biennale\">Joan Jonas</a>, who this spring will show five decades\u2019 worth of groundbreaking work in her first <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/joan-jonas\">Tate Modern retrospective</a> in London. </p> <p>Also in town are the likes of architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/28/david-adjaye-architect-holocaust-memorial-british-ghanaian\">David Adjaye</a>, cultural theorist <a href=\"http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/bhabha/bhabha1.html\">Homi K Bhabha</a>, theatre director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cartmell_selina?lang=en\">Selina Cartmell</a>, as well as the artist and opera director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/10/out-of-south-africa-how-politics-animated-the-art-of-william-kentridge\">William Kentridge</a>. Why are they all here? Well, most of them are currently looking at work by <a href=\"http://www.thaonguyenphan.com/\">Thao-Nguyen Phan</a>, a 30-year-old Vietnamese artist few, if any, will have previously heard of. </p> <p>Phan\u2019s exhibition is the first of a weekend of events organised by Rolex, as part of its <a href=\"http://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/\">Mentor and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Arts Initiative</a>. Every two years, after scouring the world for talent, the company pairs an established artist with an up-and-coming one, usually from a different country. An idea that would have been familiar to the old masters, the hope is that the younger artist can learn from \u2013 and perhaps collaborate with \u2013 the elder over the course of a couple of years. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72d05b3dc78b25edaa5eb81bdf1939fcbf037454\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72d05b3dc78b25edaa5eb81bdf1939fcbf037454/0_0_6385_4386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnam\u2019s Thao-Nguyen Phan shows her work to mentor Joan Jonas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vietnam\u2019s Thao-Nguyen Phan shows her work to mentor Joan Jonas.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As well as those mentioned above, the current crop of mentors include Gravity director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/alfonso-cuaron\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n</a>, composer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass\">Philip Glass</a>, Mozambican writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/15/mia-couto-interview-i-am-white-and-african-i-like-to-unite-contradictory-worlds\">Mia Couto</a>, theatre director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/robert-lepage\">Robert Lepage</a>, architect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-chipperfield\">David Chipperfield</a> and choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/australia-culture-blog/2014/mar/08/ohad-naharin-going-gaga-is-the-difference-between-dancer-and-gymnast\">Ohad Naharin</a>. Rolex\u2019s only stipulation is that the artists spend a minimum of six weeks together. The firm gives 100,000 Swiss francs (\u00a376,650) to each mentor and 40,000 to the proteges. It also funds travel and expenses, which all adds up to a hefty sum, given the global nature of the enterprise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very open,\u201d says Kentridge, who mentored the Colombian artist <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/mateo-lopez-travel-without-movement-2008-10\">Mateo L\u00f3pez</a> in 2012. \u201cIf we\u2019d said, \u2018Actually we want to spend three weeks in the Antarctic on a cruise\u2019, Rolex would have done that.\u201d Kentridge, like the 100 or so other mentors and proteges who have participated in the scheme so far, gets invited back every couple of years for weekends like the one I am attending in Berlin. Here, mentors introduce work they and their proteges have made, or discuss how the process worked if there\u2019s nothing that can be shown.</p> <p>The event concludes with a lavish dinner ceremony as the proteges are sent off into the world. Many have gone on to achieve considerable success. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/11/ben-frost-aurora-interview-sydney-festival-mofo\">Ben Frost</a>, mentored by Brian Eno in 2010, has taken his particular brand of extreme noise terror everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB9hKpQVk9Y\">Netflix\u2019s Dark</a> to an opera adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/06/wasp-factory-opera-house-review\">The Wasp Factory</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/28/naomi-alderman-interview-the-power\">Naomi Alderman</a>, mentored by Margaret Atwood in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/07/baileys-prize-naomi-alderman-the-power\">won the Baileys prize five years later</a>. </p> <p>The previous arts weekend was in Mexico City, while 2012\u2019s took place in Venice. Given that everyone is flown in from around the world and put up at a five-star hotel, it\u2019s easy to see the appeal of returning. But there are also opportunities to meet old friends and strike up new collaborations \u2013 with the incentive that Rolex will stump up another 30,000 for a follow-up project. <br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b290af157373411d8feaaaae2b287e1a4ed2d9bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b290af157373411d8feaaaae2b287e1a4ed2d9bd/0_573_8272_5627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Architect David Adjaye with Mariam Kamara of Niger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"680\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Architect David Adjaye with Mariam Kamara of Niger.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stephen Frears mentored the Peruvian film-maker <a href=\"https://www.cinencuentro.com/josue-mendez/\">Josu\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez</a> in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe environment,\u201d says M\u00e9ndez. \u201cThere\u2019s time, which is the most precious thing.

Cuar\u00f3n stipulated that he wanted \u201ca woman from the third world\u201d to mentor, though he ended up with a man, the Indian film-maker Chaitanya Tamhane. </p> <p>Cuar\u00f3n realised Tamhane was a better fit for his forthcoming film <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/roma-alfonso-cuaron-behind-the-scenes-1201816955/\">Roma</a>, an arthouse black-and-white work that contains plenty of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s famed technical aplomb. \u201cOne film-maker was doing stuff in <a href=\"https://www.kodak.com/consumer/region/changeregion/?blitz=off&amp;RedirectToUrl=/consumer/products/super8/default.htm\">Super 8</a>.

      "bodyText": "The crowd wandering through Berlin\u2019s Gem\u00e4ldegalerie may look like any other bunch of gallery-goers keeping out of the snow on a Saturday afternoon. Seasoned culture vultures, however, would recognise that the lanky, shaven-headed man in an Adidas jacket is choreographer Wayne McGregor; that the Irishman in an overcoat is novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn; and that the energetic, white-haired woman in glasses is Joan Jonas, who this spring will show five decades\u2019 worth of groundbreaking work in her first Tate Modern retrospective in London. Also in town are the likes of architect David Adjaye, cultural theorist Homi K Bhabha, theatre director Selina Cartmell, as well as the artist and opera director William Kentridge. Why are they all here? Well, most of them are currently looking at work by Thao-Nguyen Phan, a 30-year-old Vietnamese artist few, if any, will have previously heard of. Phan\u2019s exhibition is the first of a weekend of events organised by Rolex, as part of its Mentor and Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Arts Initiative. Every two years, after scouring the world for talent, the company pairs an established artist with an up-and-coming one, usually from a different country. An idea that would have been familiar to the old masters, the hope is that the younger artist can learn from \u2013 and perhaps collaborate with \u2013 the elder over the course of a couple of years. As well as those mentioned above, the current crop of mentors include Gravity director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, composer Philip Glass, Mozambican writer Mia Couto, theatre director Robert Lepage, architect David Chipperfield and choreographer Ohad Naharin. Rolex\u2019s only stipulation is that the artists spend a minimum of six weeks together. The firm gives 100,000 Swiss francs (\u00a376,650) to each mentor and 40,000 to the proteges. It also funds travel and expenses, which all adds up to a hefty sum, given the global nature of the enterprise. \u201cIt\u2019s very open,\u201d says Kentridge, who mentored the Colombian artist Mateo L\u00f3pez in 2012. \u201cIf we\u2019d said, \u2018Actually we want to spend three weeks in the Antarctic on a cruise\u2019, Rolex would have done that.\u201d Kentridge, like the 100 or so other mentors and proteges who have participated in the scheme so far, gets invited back every couple of years for weekends like the one I am attending in Berlin. Here, mentors introduce work they and their proteges have made, or discuss how the process worked if there\u2019s nothing that can be shown. The event concludes with a lavish dinner ceremony as the proteges are sent off into the world. Many have gone on to achieve considerable success. Ben Frost, mentored by Brian Eno in 2010, has taken his particular brand of extreme noise terror everywhere from Netflix\u2019s Dark to an opera adaptation of The Wasp Factory. Naomi Alderman, mentored by Margaret Atwood in 2012, won the Baileys prize five years later. The previous arts weekend was in Mexico City, while 2012\u2019s took place in Venice. Given that everyone is flown in from around the world and put up at a five-star hotel, it\u2019s easy to see the appeal of returning. But there are also opportunities to meet old friends and strike up new collaborations \u2013 with the incentive that Rolex will stump up another 30,000 for a follow-up project. Stephen Frears mentored the Peruvian film-maker Josu\u00e9 M\u00e9ndez in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe environment,\u201d says M\u00e9ndez. \u201cThere\u2019s time, which is the most precious thing. They\u2019re building this community. It\u2019s a really nice family.\u201d Though he has lost touch with Frears, M\u00e9ndez is developing a TV script with the Colombian writer Antonio Garc\u00eda \u00c1ngel, a protege who was mentored by the Peruvian Nobel-winner Mario Vargas Llosa. There\u2019s no way of applying for the scheme: instead, experts amass a list of two dozen or so likely candidates in each genre, whittle this to three, then present the final trio to the relevant mentor, who spends time with them before reaching a decision. Cuar\u00f3n stipulated that he wanted \u201ca woman from the third world\u201d to mentor, though he ended up with a man, the Indian film-maker Chaitanya Tamhane. Cuar\u00f3n realised Tamhane was a better fit for his forthcoming film Roma, an arthouse black-and-white work that contains plenty of Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s famed technical aplomb. \u201cOne film-maker was doing stuff in Super 8. Her stuff is fantastic \u2013 it\u2019s just her arrival to a set, with all the toys and tools I\u2019m working with, was going to be a bit irrelevant for her process.\u201d What made Jonas choose Phan? \u201cI thought her paintings were really beautiful and interesting,\u201d she says, adding that she was also \u201cvery happy to give a woman the opportunity to show her work outside of Vietnam, to be exposed. I know from experience that young artists who are men have a slightly easier time than women.\u201d Rebecca Irvin, Rolex\u2019s head of philanthropy, says the project\u2019s diversity is largely due to the mentors and the international nature of the programme (artists have come from 34 countries to date). \u201cCertain mentors will say, \u2018I want to help young film-makers from Asia and Africa.\u2019 We don\u2019t have quotas, we\u2019re not following some kind of political agenda, it\u2019s happening organically.\u201d Not everyone gets the memo, however: there are grumbles about the all-white, middle-aged and male panel led by Chipperfield to discuss urban planning, especially when at the end a woman in the audience gets up to ask a question and it\u2019s decided that there isn\u2019t time to squeeze it in. There\u2019s also the question of what Rolex gets out of it. Palestinian film-maker Annemarie Jacir was mentored by Zhang Yimou in 2010 as he made The Flowers of War, which required trips to China and a translator, all provided by the firm. Nonetheless, Jacir says that \u2013 even after further support for her film Wajib, Palestine\u2019s entry for best foreign-language film at this year\u2019s Oscars \u2013 Rolex\u2019s money comes without strings attached. \u201cWith other companies that do this kind of thing,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s all about putting their name out there, about branding. I have not had that feeling with Rolex.\u201d So the lead character didn\u2019t have to wear a big Rolex? \u201cExactly!\u201d says Jacir. \u201cThey don\u2019t ask that I wear one everywhere. When they supported my film, they didn\u2019t have any conditions. I put a thank you in the credits, but they didn\u2019t ask. That is very unusual. Everybody else \u2013 you get $1,000 and you have to have their logo.\u201d Other projects shown over the Berlin weekend include a four-screen reinvention of Macbeth by Argentine theatre director Mat\u00edas Umpierrez, starring his mentor Lepage; and a discussion between Mia Couto and his protege, the Brazilian Juli\u00e1n Fuks. The talks and performances conclude with the Peruvian musician Pauchi Sasaki, who emerges into the auditorium of the Deutches Theater wearing a dress covered in speakers, after an introduction by Philip Glass. What did the minimalist musical pioneer advise her about? \u201cThe practicalities of the music world, how to navigate the business part \u2013 how do you make a living?\u201d Glass said he wanted a protege as he himself had once been in such a role, when as a young man he assisted sitar player and composer Ravi Shankar on a film score in the 60s: \u201cHe was very important to me.\u201d With former mentors including Martin Scorsese and David Hockney, and Adjaye, T\u00f3ib\u00edn, Indian tabla master Zakir Hussain and choreographer Crystal Pite signed up for the next cycle, it\u2019s no wonder that Umpierrez and Tamhane had for years hoped to get on to the scheme. Yet it\u2019s not just the prestige and generous budgets that appeal to the mentors \u2013 or, indeed, the watch Irvin says they may be given as a gift \u201cif they do a good job\u201d. It\u2019s the opportunity to engage with a younger generation. As Cuar\u00f3n says, to remain relevant as an artist, \u201cyou have to connect with the young masters who teach you the new lessons of cinema\u201d. Otherwise, he adds, you end up being like Billy Wilder, a once-transgressive film-maker who \u201ccould not jump into the revolution of the 60s, and the last few of his films were kind of irrelevant. He was completely out of touch.\u201d The older artists also produce work during the process: Jonas made a video while travelling with Phan in Vietnam, which will form part of an installation in her Tate show. Phan is 50 years younger than Jonas, though the Vietnamese artist says: \u201cI think she has more energy and more creativity than me.\u201d The two will continue to collaborate after the scheme: Phan is in a collective of Vietnamese artists, and Jonas will make a work with them to show in Pittsburgh this year. Sitting with Umpierrez, Lepage says the scheme provides a \u201cfountain of youth\u201d for older artists who have inevitably lost the bullishness of their hungry years. \u201cWe\u2019re all full of doubt,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more you know, the less you\u2019re sure of. At a younger age, you know less but you\u2019re more confident, and that\u2019s very uplifting. That\u2019s why you hang on to younger people who say, \u2018Go all the way.\u2019\u201d",

The question we\u2019re not asking is: at what cost?</p> <p>Britain\u2019s cultural approach to family has long been reinforced by its economy and its education system. In Victorian Britain, working-class young people left home in their early teens to enter domestic service, at one point <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19544309\" title=\"\">the country\u2019s biggest source of jobs</a>. Half a century ago, baby boomers came of age in a world of cheap housing and plentiful jobs, which eased their route to independence. The number of young people going to university, many of them moving away from home, has ballooned from <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/degrees-of-failure-do-universities-actually-do-any-good\" title=\"\">just 2%</a> immediately after the second world war to <a href=\"https://www.ucas.com/file/86541/download?token=PQnaAI5f#page=46\" title=\"\">over 40% today</a>.</p> <p>At the other end of the lifespan, as people live longer \u2013 though often with protracted spells of poor health \u2013 we\u2019ve developed a professional care sector so that adult children don\u2019t have to give up work to look after ageing parents.

That generous baby-boomer deal is a thing of the past: <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/families/datasets/youngadultslivingwiththeirparents\" title=\"\">one in five 25- to 29-year-olds</a> now live with their parents. The eye-watering costs of childcare mean more parents are relying on grandparents helping out to enable them to go back to work. And the rising cost of elderly care means those who need it are often reluctant to fork out. Rather than dip into the value of their house to pay, they would prefer to pass the property on to their children.</p> <p>These financial shifts are being compounded by government policy. The tripling of tuition fees and the axing of maintenance grants have loaded further debt on to young graduates. Last year the government revived its plans to <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/housing-benefits-cuts-plan-for-18-to-21s-revived-by-government-10788982\" title=\"\">scrap support for the housing costs</a> of low-income 18- to 21-year-olds. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/dec/10/care-for-elderly-crisis-how-to-improve-quality-of-life\" title=\"\">Cuts to social care</a> have implicitly shifted the balance of responsibility for looking after ageing parents, and ministers have explicitly said families <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/31/take-care-of-your-elderly-mothers-and-fathers-says-tory-minister\" title=\"\">must pitch in more</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Much of this is happening by stealth, without any public debate about the profound consequences</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The relationship between government policy and family life has always been sensitive. The notion that what goes on in the home is no business of the state has been fiercely guarded by the Conservatives. But the reality is, of course, that no such distinction exists. Day in, day out, government policy profoundly affects family life. The left has long seen social policy as a lever to level up, so that the benefits some get through their family don\u2019t, as far as possible, operate to the detriment of others. For instance, one of the key thrusts of progressive education policy in recent decades has been to try to counter the fact that by the age of five, children from poor families will have <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/10/american-kids-are-starving-for-words/381552/\" title=\"\">heard 30 million fewer words</a> than children from wealthier backgrounds.</p> <p>A state that is far too cautious about tackling the housing crisis, and that pulls back from providing financial support for young adults and care for older people, produces grim outcomes for those whose families cannot, or will not, bail them out. And much of this is happening by stealth, without any public debate about&#xa0;the profound consequences.</p> <p>Perhaps we think parents should do more for their adult children; perhaps we think it does come down to us to pick up more of the slack in caring for ageing parents. Perhaps we think it\u2019s OK that a woman on an average income can\u2019t afford to go back to work after having a baby unless she can rely on the child\u2019s grandparents. But were we to enthusiastically embrace this worldview, there would be huge ramifications, not just for people\u2019s lifestyles but for social inequality, people\u2019s quality of life towards the end of their years, and \u2013 save nothing short of a gender revolution \u2013 for women\u2019s role in the labour market.</p> <p>A member of the boomerang generation might find it frustrating living with parents near a city rich in jobs. But for those whose parents don\u2019t have a spare room within commuting distance, getting a job with decent prospects might be nigh-on impossible. And it\u2019s easy for politicians, despite the rising numbers of older people with conditions such as advanced dementia that require specialist care, to implore people to provide more care for their ageing parents \u2013 perhaps with countries such as Japan in mind. But Japan has had its own problems: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/28/japan-elderly-care-mutual-support\" title=\"\">a growing number of resentful relatives</a> abusing the older people they felt forced to care for prompted its government to set up a new social care scheme back in 2000.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/04/ageing-nhs-loneliness-co-housing\">We need to talk about ageing \u2013 and it\u2019s about far more than the NHS | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If we were to carry on rolling back state-funded care in Britain, it would inevitably be women who\u2019d feel obliged to give up work to care for older relatives, storing up financial problems for their own old age. Some ageing people without family members willing to care for them would simply fall through the cracks.</p> <p>Even those whose families could do this might find themselves physically taken care of but with their emotional health suffering as relationships break down under the strain. Duty might&#xa0;kick in, but we would be kidding ourselves if we thought we could reverse-engineer the evolutionary urge to make huge sacrifices for our children.</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not lovely when some opt for a more multi-generational family life. But it should be an active choice. Structuring the state in a way that forces people to embrace a Mediterranean approach is wrong. We can\u2019t answer the question of how big we want the state to be without asking how much our families should feel obliged to do for us \u2013 and how much&#xa0;we care about the potential price in terms of growing social and gender inequality.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is the chief leader writer at the Observer</p>",

Broaden out the focus to siblings, adult children, ageing parents, aunts and uncles, and the answer is less straightforward. Britain\u2019s more individualistic approach to family is often contrasted with family cultures in southern Europe. There, young people tend to leave the parental home later, and it is much more common to find three or even four generations of the same family living under the one roof. But as the UK\u2019s housing crisis has given way to a \u201cboomerang generation\u201d of young people in their 20s still living at home, and as the shrinking amount of state funding for older care leaves more families to fend for themselves, there are signs that we might be starting to embrace a more Mediterranean approach to family life. The question we\u2019re not asking is: at what cost? Britain\u2019s cultural approach to family has long been reinforced by its economy and its education system. In Victorian Britain, working-class young people left home in their early teens to enter domestic service, at one point the country\u2019s biggest source of jobs. Half a century ago, baby boomers came of age in a world of cheap housing and plentiful jobs, which eased their route to independence. The number of young people going to university, many of them moving away from home, has ballooned from just 2% immediately after the second world war to over 40% today. At the other end of the lifespan, as people live longer \u2013 though often with protracted spells of poor health \u2013 we\u2019ve developed a professional care sector so that adult children don\u2019t have to give up work to look after ageing parents. By contrast, in countries such as Japan and Italy, where there is a greater expectation that families will step up, there has been less reliance on professional care: across much of Italy, fewer than one in 50 over-85s live in a care home, compared with one in six in the UK. But we\u2019ve now reached the point where our cultural preferences for generational separation are being tested, rather than shored up, by economic realities. That generous baby-boomer deal is a thing of the past: one in five 25- to 29-year-olds now live with their parents. The eye-watering costs of childcare mean more parents are relying on grandparents helping out to enable them to go back to work. And the rising cost of elderly care means those who need it are often reluctant to fork out. Rather than dip into the value of their house to pay, they would prefer to pass the property on to their children. These financial shifts are being compounded by government policy. The tripling of tuition fees and the axing of maintenance grants have loaded further debt on to young graduates. Last year the government revived its plans to scrap support for the housing costs of low-income 18- to 21-year-olds. Cuts to social care have implicitly shifted the balance of responsibility for looking after ageing parents, and ministers have explicitly said families must pitch in more. The relationship between government policy and family life has always been sensitive. The notion that what goes on in the home is no business of the state has been fiercely guarded by the Conservatives. But the reality is, of course, that no such distinction exists. Day in, day out, government policy profoundly affects family life. The left has long seen social policy as a lever to level up, so that the benefits some get through their family don\u2019t, as far as possible, operate to the detriment of others. For instance, one of the key thrusts of progressive education policy in recent decades has been to try to counter the fact that by the age of five, children from poor families will have heard 30 million fewer words than children from wealthier backgrounds. A state that is far too cautious about tackling the housing crisis, and that pulls back from providing financial support for young adults and care for older people, produces grim outcomes for those whose families cannot, or will not, bail them out. And much of this is happening by stealth, without any public debate about the profound consequences. Perhaps we think parents should do more for their adult children; perhaps we think it does come down to us to pick up more of the slack in caring for ageing parents. Perhaps we think it\u2019s OK that a woman on an average income can\u2019t afford to go back to work after having a baby unless she can rely on the child\u2019s grandparents. But were we to enthusiastically embrace this worldview, there would be huge ramifications, not just for people\u2019s lifestyles but for social inequality, people\u2019s quality of life towards the end of their years, and \u2013 save nothing short of a gender revolution \u2013 for women\u2019s role in the labour market. A member of the boomerang generation might find it frustrating living with parents near a city rich in jobs. But for those whose parents don\u2019t have a spare room within commuting distance, getting a job with decent prospects might be nigh-on impossible. And it\u2019s easy for politicians, despite the rising numbers of older people with conditions such as advanced dementia that require specialist care, to implore people to provide more care for their ageing parents \u2013 perhaps with countries such as Japan in mind. But Japan has had its own problems: a growing number of resentful relatives abusing the older people they felt forced to care for prompted its government to set up a new social care scheme back in 2000. If we were to carry on rolling back state-funded care in Britain, it would inevitably be women who\u2019d feel obliged to give up work to care for older relatives, storing up financial problems for their own old age. Some ageing people without family members willing to care for them would simply fall through the cracks. Even those whose families could do this might find themselves physically taken care of but with their emotional health suffering as relationships break down under the strain. Duty might kick in, but we would be kidding ourselves if we thought we could reverse-engineer the evolutionary urge to make huge sacrifices for our children. That\u2019s not to say that it\u2019s not lovely when some opt for a more multi-generational family life. But it should be an active choice. Structuring the state in a way that forces people to embrace a Mediterranean approach is wrong. We can\u2019t answer the question of how big we want the state to be without asking how much our families should feel obliged to do for us \u2013 and how much we care about the potential price in terms of growing social and gender inequality. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is the chief leader writer at the Observer",

Not wishing to leave it to drain its batteries, I closed my fist over the butterfly, and its wings stopped beating. I popped it into a sealed tub in the chill porch to let it slide back into torpidity. A few hours later, we had fashioned a hibernaculum, a small open-ended box with cardboard partitions. The butterfly seemed a not unwilling tenant, fingering the wall of its new home with its feet, settling to hold fast with wings clasped shut behind. There was a shelf in the shed with a space that might have been labelled \u201creserved for hibernation\u201d. I put the box down and shut the door, but went back to check the next morning. The butterfly was hanging inside, much as I had left it, but I pushed its container gently so that it was lodged safely at the back of the shelf. Not gently enough, for the peacock made a swan-like whooshing sound as it beat its wings in distress. Moments later, all was still again. I closed a door behind me that will stay closed until spring, when I hope the occupant will have disappeared, leaving no wings behind.",

The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, has promised that PrEP (Pre-exposure prophylaxis) \u2013 a daily preventative drug that reduces the risk of HIV infection by up to 99% \u2013 will be added to Australia\u2019s Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) if the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommends it. PBS listing would bring the price of PrEP , which is sold in Australia under the brand name Truvada, down to $39.50 for a monthly prescription. Truvada currently costs an estimated $850 a month, while cheaper, generic brands of PrEP cost $130 a month through private import. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will release its decision on Friday but, on Thursday, Fairfax Media reported that a positive recommendation for PrEP was \u201calmost certain\u201d. If that happens, Hunt has given a commitment to list PrEP on the PBS. PrEP is an antiretroviral drug to be taken by those at high risk of HIV infection. Among gay and bisexual men, it has an efficacy of rate of 99% if used every day. It does not prevent other STIs and the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations recommends it be used in addition to condoms. Truvada was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association in May 2016, meaning that any doctor could prescribe it, but, until now, consumers were forced to pay retail prices, or import the drug themselves. However, the maximum patient contribution for a PBS-listed drug is $39.50, or $6.50 for a concession card holder. Each Truvada prescription lasts one month. Darryl O\u2019Donnell, the chief executive of the Australian Federation of Aids Organisations (AFAO), said improving access to PrEP, especially in migrant and Indigenous communities, was now the next step. \u201cPrEP will make a huge difference but it only helps if it its in the hands of people who can benefit from it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are populations, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait communities, who don\u2019t have the same kind of health service access to come forward and ask about PrEP. [PBS listing] needs to be accompanied by health promotion, outreach and educating doctors and pharmacists in prescribing it. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of stigma associated with HIV and a lot of people feel reluctant to talk to a doctor or disclose they are a person with HIV.\u201d According to the University of New South Wales annual survey, an estimated 26,000 Australians live with HIV as of 2016. The rate of HIV notifications has dropped over the past five years, except in Aboriginal and Torres populations, where it has increased. The annual number of Aids diagnoses has also declined rapidly since 1994, due to the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy in preventing Aids from developing. It has not been a notifiable disease since 2010 and is no longer considered a public health issue. A spokeswoman for the health department told Guardian Australia that the advisory committee had already discussed PrEP at a special meeting on 15 December last year but would not release the decision until tomorrow. All Australian states and territories have a goal of ending new HIV infections by 2020. Since TGA approval, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland implemented free trials of PrEP for roughly 13,000 Australians. It has 84% efficacy for heterosexual men and women and 70% efficacy for people who inject drugs. The AFAO says it is not a substitute for established harm reduction measures such as needle and syringe exchanges.",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Telegraph has argued that articles about Geoffrey Rush published late last year \u201cdid not make any allegations\u201d that the actor \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour of a sexual nature\u201d. But the newspaper\u2019s defence in defamation proceedings filed by Rush will remain unknown for the time being after lawyers for the actor successfully had the document suppressed on Thursday. In the first hearing of the defamation proceedings filed by the 66-year-old actor against the tabloid newspaper on Thursday, Rush\u2019s barrister Richard McHugh SC successfully argued that the defence should not be released because it contained \u201crumours\u201d which would do \u201cfurther damage\u201d to the actor\u2019s reputation. McHugh argued the defence contained \u201cscandalous\u201d information which went \u201cvastly\u201d beyond what had previously been published by the Telegraph. Justice Michael Wigney agreed, saying protecting Rush\u2019s reputation from further harm outweighed the public interest in releasing what he said would have to be a heavily redacted version of the defence. During Thursday\u2019s hearing McHugh first sought to have the Daily Telegraph\u2019s defence struck out entirely on the basis that the defence of truth and qualified privilege was \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d and would, he argued, be abandoned at trial. The qualified privilege defence in defamation hearings in Australia means a publisher must show the defamatory articles were in the public interest and that it acted reasonably. It is the same defence Fairfax Media used in its unsuccessful defence in a defamation case against cricketer Chris Gayle last year. \u201cHow anyone could describe the headline \u2018King Leer\u2019 as a fair way of reporting an unsubstantiated complaint like that is not a serious argument that can be put,\u201d McHugh said. That argument won\u2019t be heard in full until the case resumes on 19 February, but News Corp\u2019s lawyers said the fact the more \u201cscandalous\u201d material in the defence was not published was \u201ca touchstone of reasonableness\u201d, and sought to argue that the stories published by the Daily Telegraph \u201cdid not make any allegations\u201d of a sexual nature. Instead, that was an \u201cimputation\u201d made by McHugh. The articles in question were published by the Daily Telegraph in November and December last year. The Sydney Theatre Company released a statement to the Daily Telegraph saying it had received a complaint against Rush from someone who accused him of \u201cinappropriate behaviour\u201d during the company\u2019s staging of William Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear two years ago. The company did not disclose details of the allegation, saying the complainant asked that the allegation be dealt with in private and did not want Rush notified or involved in any investigation. The Daily Telegraph led its front page with the story on 30 November with the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d. A second article published on 1 December with the headline \u201cWe\u2019re with you: theatre cast back accuser as Rush denies \u2018touching\u2019\u201d contained a denial from Rush that he \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d a female cast member on the production. McHugh argued the stories were not reasonable and that they \u201cclearly\u201d contained a \u201csexual dimension\u201d. \u201cThe use of [the] headline \u2018leer\u2019 obviously has a sexual connotation to it and the way it is photographed ... makes it look like he\u2019s been caught in some way,\u201d McHugh said on Thursday. \u201cHow anyone could describe the headline \u2018King Leer\u2019 as a fair way of reporting an unsubstantiated complaint like that is not a serious argument that can be put.\u201d Rush launched defamation action against News Corp and journalist Jonathon Moran last year over the two articles. Labelling them \u201cspurious claims with bombastic titles\u201d at the time, a statement of claim lodged on behalf of Rush argues that the articles and headlines make a series of defamatory remarks about the actor, including that he had \u201cengaged in scandalously inappropriate behaviour\u201d in the theatre. The suit claims the Daily Telegraph made Rush out to be a \u201cpervert\u201d and a \u201csexual predator\u201d with their \u201cKing Leer\u201d headline. The second article could be interpreted as suggesting Rush had behaved as a \u201csexual predator\u201d, had \u201ccommitted sexual assault\u201d, was \u201c a pervert\u201d, had \u201cinappropriately touched an actress\u201d and his behaviour was so serious the STC \u201cwould never work with him again\u201d. McHugh also argued on Thursday that the Daily Telegraph articles linked the actor to the high-profile allegations of sexual assault against Hollywood figures Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, as well as Australian television personality Don Burke. The second Daily Telegraph article was published alongside an article about Burke, which Rush\u2019s lawyers allege have the effect of \u201cfalsely and unfairly\u201d associating \u201cthe allegations against the applicant with the allegations against Mr Burke\u201d.",

In an interview on 2GB radio, the home affairs minister acknowledged that he and Brandis had \u201cclashed over the years\u201d, which he said was \u201cobvious\u201d from the speech on Wednesday. In the valedictory speech, Brandis, who formally resigned from the Senate on Thursday, defended his legacy by saying he had \u201cnot disguised [his] concern at attacks upon the institutions of the law, the courts and those who practise in them. \u201cTo attack those institutions is to attack the rule of law itself.\u201d He said it was the attorney general\u2019s role to defend the rule of law \u201csometimes from political colleagues who fail to understand it, or are impatient of the limitations it may impose upon executive power\u201d. The comments were widely interpreted as a criticism of Dutton, who has recently been rebuked by by the Law Council and the Law Institute of Victoria over his claims that Victorians were \u201cscared to go out to restaurants\u201d due to street violence and that \u201ccivil libertarian\u201d judges were to blame for lenient sentences.

Dutton defended himself by saying he had been \u201cvery careful\u201d in his comments, which reflected public concerns about \u201cdisgraceful\u201d lenient sentences in Victoria. \u201cThe legal system has let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can criticise, it can be veiled, they can have the determination to try and undermine what I\u2019m doing. \u201cAll of it makes me more determined to make sure we keep going ... In the end, I want a safer society for our country.\u201d Dutton said politicians should ensure that \u201cwe don\u2019t think we\u2019re better than the public we serve or that we\u2019re the smartest person in the room, whatever it might be that motivates [my critics]\u201d. The home affairs minister said that some lawyers \u201cbelieve that they\u2019re better than elements in society\u201d. Asked if this applied to Brandis, he replied: \u201cPeople can draw their own conclusions.\u201d Dutton said that he respected legal institutions because he had never suggested that politicians should influence decisions on guilt and innocence, or admissibility of evidence. He said the courts would be stronger if they enjoyed public support. Last Friday the Law Council rebuked Dutton for a plan to allow public feedback on a shortlisted nominees for judicial positions, warning that the \u201cquasi-election\u201d model that would politicise the judiciary. Brandis also said that successive tranches of national security legislation had succeeded because they were bipartisan. \u201cI have heard some powerful voices argue that the Coalition should open a political front against the Labor party on the issue of domestic national security,\u201d he said, warning that to do so would undermine public confidence. \u201cNothing could be more irresponsible than to hazard the safety of the public by creating a confected dispute for political advantage. \u201cTo his credit, the prime minister has always resisted such entreaties.\u201d Before the attorney general\u2019s portfolio was handed to Christian Porter, and Brandis announced that he would depart to London as Australia\u2019s next high commissioner, he lost a stoush inside the cabinet for oversight of national security bodies, which has been transferred to Dutton\u2019s new home affairs super department.",

His current whereabouts are unknown. </p> <p>The Guardian understands that on the day Gui Minhai was taken, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, went to China\u2019s foreign ministry seeking answers. Swedish diplomats were referred to police in Ningbo who confirmed the bookseller was in detention and suspected of trafficking in state secrets. </p> <p>Angela Gui said: \u201cThere is no way that he would know any state secrets that wouldn\u2019t have anything directly to do with his case. He was in incommunicado detention for two years. So who would have told him these state secrets?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI can only guess that it might have something to do with what happened when he was taken the first time. And that whoever ordered this didn\u2019t want this to come out,\u201d she added.</p> <p>China has dismissed criticism of its treatment of Gui, who supporters say was seeking medical treatment in Beijing because of fears he was suffering from a rare neurological disease. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe Swedish side should know the case is serious in nature and some Swedish people have played an irresponsible role in this,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.se/20180206/china-hits-back-at-sweden-over-bookseller-gui-minhai\">told reporters</a>, warning further criticism could damage bilateral relations. <br></p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1088727.shtml\">an editorial</a> in the Communist party-run tabloid, the Global Times, accused Sweden and Germany of \u201crudely provoking China\u2019s judicial sovereignty\u201d and claimed both countries should be ashamed of their \u201cimperialist\u201d meddling.</p> <p>Angela Gui urged more western governments to confront Beijing over her father\u2019s plight. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be vocal and public about this and really I would have wished that this would have happened since the very beginning when he was taken 2015. I can\u2019t help but wonder if the international community had been more vocal back then, if we would have this situation today.\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cNobody knows what is going to happen now. But if China is claiming he committed all these crimes, and if they are not backing down on that, that suggests there\u2019s going to be a trial.

Four other booksellers, including one British citizen, were also seized leading to criticism from politicians in the UK, including then foreign secretary Philip Hammond. Gui, who became a Swedish citizen in 1992, had seemed close to release last autumn when it emerged he was living under surveillance in the eastern port city of Ningbo. However, those hopes were dashed when he was apprehended for the second time. His current whereabouts are unknown. The Guardian understands that on the day Gui Minhai was taken, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to China, Anna Lindstedt, went to China\u2019s foreign ministry seeking answers. Swedish diplomats were referred to police in Ningbo who confirmed the bookseller was in detention and suspected of trafficking in state secrets. Angela Gui said: \u201cThere is no way that he would know any state secrets that wouldn\u2019t have anything directly to do with his case. He was in incommunicado detention for two years. So who would have told him these state secrets?\u201d \u201cI can only guess that it might have something to do with what happened when he was taken the first time. And that whoever ordered this didn\u2019t want this to come out,\u201d she added. China has dismissed criticism of its treatment of Gui, who supporters say was seeking medical treatment in Beijing because of fears he was suffering from a rare neurological disease. \u201cThe Swedish side should know the case is serious in nature and some Swedish people have played an irresponsible role in this,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters, warning further criticism could damage bilateral relations. On Thursday an editorial in the Communist party-run tabloid, the Global Times, accused Sweden and Germany of \u201crudely provoking China\u2019s judicial sovereignty\u201d and claimed both countries should be ashamed of their \u201cimperialist\u201d meddling. Angela Gui urged more western governments to confront Beijing over her father\u2019s plight. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be vocal and public about this and really I would have wished that this would have happened since the very beginning when he was taken 2015. I can\u2019t help but wonder if the international community had been more vocal back then, if we would have this situation today.\u201d \u201cNobody knows what is going to happen now. But if China is claiming he committed all these crimes, and if they are not backing down on that, that suggests there\u2019s going to be a trial. And I expect that if there is indeed a trial he will probably get a very long sentence because of the nature of the crimes he is suspected of.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The South Australian government is talking up the future of pumped hydro energy storage with grants announced for four projects before the 17 March election. Grants ranging from $500,000 to $4.7m have been promised to conduct feasibility studies for pumped hydro power plants near Whyalla, Port Augusta and Port Germein. The state\u2019s energy minister, Tom Koutsantonis, said: \u201cThe key to lowering power prices in South Australia is boosting competition and these projects have the potential to dispatch cheap renewable energy when demand is high.\u201d British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s GFG Alliance, which recently invested in Whyalla steelworks, will receive $500,000 towards a $1.7m feasibility study for a pumped hydro plant at a mine site in the Middleback Ranges. Gupta said the project would look at the engineering and geotechnical challenges along with commercial evaluations of converting the depleted iron ore pit into a pumped hydro plant. \u201cThis can be a game changer for our highly energy intensive industries such as steel and aluminium,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cA dramatic reduction in power price is the most important ingredient needed for an industrial renaissance in Australia. \u201cThe cost of solar and wind is rapidly declining globally with the evolution of technology and economies of scale. However, without a viable large-scale storage solution this revolution is incomplete and unsustainable.\u201d In other projects, $4.7m was granted towards a 230MW pumped hydro energy storage facility near Port Augusta. The plant would require $410m to be built. A potential 225MW hydro project at Cultana, north of Whyalla, was given $500,000 towards a feasibility study and a $3m grant will go towards a possible $406m pumped hydro project north-east of Port Germein. Labor continued to push its renewable energy credentials during the election campaign. On Sunday, it announced \u201cthe world\u2019s largest virtual power plant\u201d \u2013 a network of at least 50,000 home solar systems backed up by battery storage to cut energy bills. The South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, said a trial was already under way to install solar panels and Tesla batteries on 1,100 Housing Trust homes. The cost would be financed by the sale of electricity. The power generated by the solar panels and the batteries would not be owned directly by the households. The program would later be rolled out to another 24,000 public housing properties and also offered to other households with a view to having at least 50,000 Adelaide homes connected. The Liberals are trying to unseat the Labor government, which has been in power since 2002 and is bidding for a record fifth straight term. But both the major parties are expecting to a strong challenge from Nick Xenophon\u2019s SA Best group. The popular former senator plans to run candidates in up to 30 of the state\u2019s 47 lower-house seats. \u2022 With Australian Associated Press",

      "bodyText": "Initial designs for a tunnel at Stonehenge have been published, seeking to show how the \u00a31.6bn scheme could restore a sense of beauty and tranquillity to the ancient landscape. A slightly longer tunnel than previously mooted has been proposed \u2013 spanning just under two miles (3km) \u2013 to counter concerns that precious barrow burial mounds could be damaged and a view of the setting sun at the winter solstice lost. A grass-covered canopy at the western end of the tunnel is also featured to try to conceal the road and help the scheme blend into the landscape. Also included is a viaduct to carry the road over the river Till, west of the tunnel. However, three heritage bodies closely involved with the Unesco site have expressed surprise and concern that under the plan, which is supposed to remove the sound and sight of traffic, a new route for vehicles on the surface and close to the stone circle would be created. Other groups opposed to the tunnel go further, claiming the project will wreck the site, and want it scrapped completely. Highways England published the designs at the start of a public consultation phase that runs until April. It said it was seeking feedback to help shape the scheme further before it submitted an application for a development consent order, which it said it hoped to do by the end of the year. It explained the route had been chosen to avoid monuments and barrow groups and to avoid intrusion on views of the winter solstice. Highways England said that by taking the A303 underground it would reconnect the two halves of the site that has been spilt by the road for decades. Under the plan, work on the tunnel will begin by 2021 and be completed by 2025. English Heritage, the National Trust and Historic England support the concept and, in a joint statement, welcomed what they see as improvements to the western end. But the bodies flagged up particular concerns about the linking of two ancient byways, currently separated by the A303. If the byways are joined as is suggested, it could mean vehicles will still pass close to the circle, albeit going slower than on the A303 and in much smaller numbers. The three organiations said: \u201cWe are very concerned about the detrimental impact of traffic on the byways and believe this will be made worse by the proposal to link existing byways after the surface A303 is removed. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reunite this ancient landscape, giving people the opportunity to tread pathways used by our ancestors who built the monuments, to visit and appreciate the monuments and see and hear wildlife without the intrusion of the traffic and noise.\u201d Ian Morrison, the director of planning for Historic England, said: \u201cThe primary purpose of the scheme is to remove the A303 from the centre of the landscape.\u201d The proposal to connect the byways opened up the prospect of 4x4s trundling close to the stones and people setting up camp there, he said, adding: \u201cThere is a danger you will continue to have motorised vehicles travelling through the landscape.\u201d One option might be to try to ban motorised vehicles from the byways, though this will be resisted by people who use the routes to get close to the stones without having to pay the site\u2019s custodians, English Heritage. The Stonehenge Alliance, which includes archaeologists and environmental campaigners, called the plan an \u201cinternational scandal\u201d. It said the new road would be \u201cgouged\u201d through the chalk and argued: \u201cHowever well-designed, the devastating impact of this road engineering would destroy archaeology and deeply scar this iconic landscape and its setting forever.\u201d Kate Fielden, the vice-chairman of Rescue \u2013 the British Archaeological Trust, said: \u201cOur government proposes to spend \u00a31.6bn trashing a world heritage site.\u201d Si\u00f4n Elis Williams of Friends of the Earth said: \u201cInstead of building another road that increases traffic, money for the road scheme could be invested in a region that is crying out for significant investment in its bus and rail network to increase accessibility, improve air quality and boost sustainable tourism.\u201d If the tunnel does go ahead, at the eastern end the road would pass beneath a feature called the Avenue, believed to be a ceremonial approach to Stonehenge from the river Avon. This would allow visitors and pilgrims to follow the ancient route safely for the first time in decades.",

Sara Thornton, the chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the volume of data held by individuals had massively increased the number of potential lines of enquiry that officers must pursue to understand a case. In recent months, several rape prosecutions have been dropped after it emerged that police had failed to hand over evidence that undermined their cases. Since then, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced a review of all current rape cases and Nick Ephgrave, the NPCC\u2019s lead on criminal justice, has admitted that police have a \u201ccultural problem\u201d with disclosure. The attorney general\u2019s guidelines on disclosure say that police have a duty to pursue all reasonable lines of investigation, leading both towards and away from a conviction, Thornton said. Raising the prospect that more challenges may emerge in the future, she said that the problem was linked to violent crime, but that \u201cin the first instance\u201d issues had emerged around sexual offences. \u201cWhat we are really challenged by is the volume of data which all of us hold in 2018, and therefore the potential for many, many more reasonable lines of enquiry than was ever the case. I\u2019m not just talking about twice as many ... the numbers that we\u2019re talking about are really significant.\u201d Thornton said that suspects and complainants should be asked at the outset of an investigation whether there might be any evidence on their phones or digital footprints which are relevant. But, with tight resources, the ultimate answer lay in technology. \u201cI think the challenge for us is how we can use technology more, beyond search terms. So how can you use ... machine learning, artificial intelligence, whatever phrase you want to use, to get clever tech to help us to do this?\u201d Such methods were already in use in civil cases, Thornton said, and the CPS has now set up a group to look at how it could be employed in criminal trials. \u201cBecause, in a way, it\u2019s technology that\u2019s causing us the big challenge, technology has got to be part of the answer, so that\u2019s what we are trying to do.\u201d Thornton\u2019s comments came ahead of an NPCC briefing on knife crime, where the organisation\u2019s lead on the issue announced a nationwide week of action from Monday. Duncan Ball, a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police, said the operation would include knife sweeps, targeted stop and search, and test purchases. Anecdotal reports from officers in units that focus on gang crime, such as the Met\u2019s Trident Command, suggested that a cut in the numbers of stop and search had given youngsters the impression they were less likely to be searched, he said. Ball also said that he would be travelling to Scotland, where authorities have taken a \u201cpublic health approach\u201d to knife crime that has led to a dramatic fall in the number of fatal stabbings. \u201cClearly, it\u2019s been successful in Scotland,\u201d Ball said. \u201cOne of the interesting things I think \u2013 and I obviously completely support the comments of the commissioner previously made in that it sort of takes a more holistic, more of a wide-system approach to how we\u2019re looking at it \u2013 is identifying how that can be transferred.\u201d However, different forces with different needs would need to apply the principles in different ways, Ball said, adding that he would guard against a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach\u201d. \u201cI think the other challenge within that [is that it\u2019s] clearly not just a policing issue, it\u2019s health, education, everything else that\u2019s involved in it. I think, again, there\u2019s a strong role for the Home Office in providing the broader strategy at the moment in terms of how the intervention, the health bit, is included.\u201d",
